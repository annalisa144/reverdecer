  Yay! Thanks for coming through for me and posting about the monarchs! :) :) :) 
  
  Having seen the ones who winter in California, I know about the magic. And about how it does NOT show up in photos. The clumps of thousands of monarchs in the trees are so hard to photograph and get anyone to see what you saw...

  Thanks for this post!!!'
