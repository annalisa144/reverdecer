  Thanks for the report. That is really funny about finding the gas in the middle of nowhere!
  Handy that part of your wait was downhill. When I was young, my parents had a '51 Chevy. I remember some trips where when we went downhill, my dad would turn the gas off. I don't know if it really in order to save some, or if it was a way to relieve boredom! It was a standard transmission; he probably popped the clutch to re-start it, tho i don't remember that part for sure.
  Yes, that would be such a perfect situation for a Prius!
  Better still, just go for all -electric and avoid the whole mess!
