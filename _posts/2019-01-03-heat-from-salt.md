We're learning to heat with salt. Had never occurred to me, but it works offgrid to keep our toes from becoming ice cubes overnight.

# Why is this better than heating with wood?

There is no fire.  The bottle gets warm, but not hot enough to start a fire. It doesn't consume oxygen or release smoke. This makes it much safer to use in a small, enclosed area like a van.

Since there is no smoke widespread use of this technology would reduce the suffering and deaths of millions of people from respiratory disease. The Global Burden of Disease study estimates that [3.5 million people](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/great-energy-challenge/2012/cookstove-smoke-is-largest-environmental-threat-global-health-study-finds/) die annually from respiratory illness due to burning wood and other biomass.
