message: "wow, that is really interesting about caffeine not being effective first thing! There was a period of time when I did not have coffee first thing on Bible study days, knowing i would have it there at 9 a.m. But then i never felt as sharp going into the Bible study, as I did if I had coffee at home at 6:30 or 7.\r\nYes, i would think w/ chilly mornings there would be double reason to want it first thing."
