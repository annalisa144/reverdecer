There is so much good food to enjoy in Morelia - with all the fresh, local produce we're happy to cook for ourselves, but every time we do go out we're impressed by how cheap delicious restaurants are. Here are some favorites:

Hotel de la Soledad is worth it for the art and atmosphere - plus the food is delicious. Great local cuisine (corundas, e.g.), fresh fruit, eggs, quesadillas, coffees, chocolate, pastries...everything is good. About $13 for the brunch buffet. One of the most "expensive" meals we've had in Morelia, and worth every peso. https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g152771-d153649-Reviews-Hotel_de_la_Soledad-Morelia_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html

Casa de la Enchilada has our favorite enchiladas placeras (Morelia-style enchiladas with potatoes and carrots) and they've recently raised the price to about $3 for a platter-full! http://michoacan.travel/es/restaurantes/la-casa-de-la-enchilada.html
