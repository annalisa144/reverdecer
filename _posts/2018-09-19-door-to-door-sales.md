We're proud of [what we haul by bike](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/23/beasts-and-bikes-of-burden/), but truck burdens are impressive, too.

Water, propane, cleaning supplies and more are delivered door-to-door by truck. Not like the Schwann's truck, which delivers your order (at least I assume that's how it works). These trucks simply drive the streets and you holler out to them to stop. Certainly, over time the drivers come to know customers and expect transactions on a specific schedule.

Many systems here depend on someone being home most of the time (also a good way to prevent theft) and I chuckle at how many systems we've perfected in the US to *not* have to interact with people. Pre-arranged and paid-online compost home pick-up, for exmaple.

To get our trash picked-up we have to be here to hand it over and pay. Though in the city we can leave some money under the trash can on the curb, and that seems to work alright. Guess they're aren't enough bored kids who want pizza money enough to roam the neighborhood looking under everyone's trash cans?

In some parts of the city, a boy carries and rings a bell along the sidewalks, perhaps a block ahead of the trash truck, so people know to bring their trash out.

We miss out on some specialized door-to-door services by living in the country. Like the sharpener who bikes up and down the streets and when someone brings out knives, machetes, scissors, etc, the sharpener flips the bike over and uses the wheel to vibrate a grindstone (or has a flip-down piece to make the bike stationary, and pedal as usual).

The old iron collector, as well, skips the country. Too bad, because we have some old iron to sell! Though now I'm soaking it in vinegar and water, hoping it will become a dye mordant.
