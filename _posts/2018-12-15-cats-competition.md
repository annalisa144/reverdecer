We think a white tail hawk is hunting in El Terreno! (Can you identify this mostly white bird of prey?) We've witnessed two dramatic dives procuring mice out of the tall grass. We're impressed. Thecats aren't keeping up with the rodents - they're amazing hunters, but they are neither hungry nor blood-thirsty enough to clear the whole hectare.

The truck provides further cat competition. Ew.

We had nothing to do with this one, but its fascinating.
