[That tent used to be our bathroom](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/04/20/pup-tent/). [Then Phillip built our classy outhouse!](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/07/home-improvements-and-graywatering-vision/) (See the cornerposts?)

The toilet is the same - want to learn how it works? Don't worry; it's clean!
