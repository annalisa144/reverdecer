  As I read this post, my heartbeat and respiration increased, feeling fearful on your behalf. And like you, I squirm at the thought of how VERY MUCH more stressful and scary border crossings are for those who don't have our White, moneyed, privilege. I've been reading Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, which is full of reminders of how much injustice occurs with big power differentials.
