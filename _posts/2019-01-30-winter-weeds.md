Winter brings a new menu of weeds to El Terreno. These are the ones we're eating regularly.

**Curly dock**

We're eating the leaves in salad or soup, and [solar dehydrating](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/10/02/solar-dehydrator-2nd-attempt/) the seeds for pancakes. (Our pancake batter - right photo - does look a little weird, huh? It's gotten [even healthier than before](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/09/how-to-make-squash-pancakes/), and I'll write about that soon!)

**Wild lettuces** and some variety of **cichorieae**

We're eating them as salad, mixed with something else since they're *bitter!* I've been trimming the plants (there are scads around) to see if newer growth will be more mild.


**Buckhorn plantain**

The leaves go in salad or soup. The seeds I'm just eating straight - I intended to [solar dehydrate](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/10/02/solar-dehydrator-2nd-attempt/) them for pancakes or bread, but I tasted some and was delighted by the rich flavor.
