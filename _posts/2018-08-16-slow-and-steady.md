By our 108th sun salute I was tired; I was glad to be done and have lunch.

The first place I felt tired was in my left shoulder, thanks to an injury from the [Insanity workout](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H1IBTXG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=annalisa144-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00H1IBTXG&linkId=d7eec4951e58be17e31e235e41a6ef5c)

It was the burpees. Of course I should've been more careful about form, but with pulsing music and the charge to do as many in 60 seconds as possible, I pulled something in that shoulder and give years later I still notice a catch sometimes when I move into down-dog.
