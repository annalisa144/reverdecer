I tried dying with black beans but it was a flop. See the three pieces of fabric on the left? Not attractive.

The yarn might hold the color better.

Now I'm trying a home-made mordant, by soaking rusty metal we've found on the land in water and vinegar. [More will be revealed.](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/03/24/botanical-dyeing-end-result/)

In [my first botanical dye experiment](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/02/21/dyeing-yarn-with-plants/), [the avocado made a great color, but didn't last](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/02/20/dyeing-with-avocado/) either.
