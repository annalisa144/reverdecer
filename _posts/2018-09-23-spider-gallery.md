Fun fact/fiction: you're never more than three feet from a spider. It's true en El Terreno, though the internet says everything from [sort of true](https://arthropodecology.com/2012/06/05/you-are-always-within-three-feet-of-a-spider-fact-or-fiction/) to [not true](https://www.burkemuseum.org/blog/myth-youre-always-within-three-feet-spider).

Thankfully spiders don't bother me (though I don't like the occasional bites). Mostly they're fascinating and often beautiful, and I don't pick them up. Here are some that we see a lot:

Crab spiders are lovely and well-named.

Paraphidippus genus, in the jumping spider family, not sure of species.

Here with the female. I haven't looked up their mating habits - not *that* interested.

They do jump.

More jumping spiders - golden and Johnson's?

The most fascinating are the lynx spiders, green and striped.

I think these are all wolf spiders (along with the header photo).

Don't all spiders have webs? No. And only the cobweb family makes three-dimensional webs.

Orbweavers build in the vertical plane, often between objects - this one picked tree branches.
