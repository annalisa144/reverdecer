  Even our sheets are too big for washing in the bucket! It simply isn't a
  complete laundry system. But it's getting us by, and we can always go to Cafe
  Gabi to use a real washing machine. Of course, now that it rains pretty much
  every day I'm not sure how we'd dry the clothes (at Gabi's we hang them on her
  rooftop). Easier to just wash here and hang here, and then hope we get enough
  sunlight in the morning to dry things. We're doing okay so far. I mean, we
  don't smell too bad, right?
