Can't think of a better Christmas present than these black bean brownies:
* Gluten-free
* Sugar-free option
* Easily vegan
* No eggs (no worry about underbaking if you like brownies gooey or you're trying to bake without an oven)
* Delicious

(Plus they have hidden nutrients!)

* 1/2 c oats (quick or normal are fine, as you prefer)
* 2 T sugar/sweetener
* 1/4 t salt (to taste)
* 1/2 t baking powder
* 2 T to 3/4 c cocoa powder (original recipe says 2 T but we used 3/4 c since we prefer serious chocolate)
* 1 (15 oz) can black beans, or about 1 3/4 c (if you are cooking yourself, say, [in a sleeping bag!)](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/21/cooking-in-a-sleeping-bag/)
* 1/3 c maple syrup
* 1/4 coconut oil, olive oil or butter (or more if you raise the cocoa powder significantly)
* 2 t vanilla
* 1 c chocolate chips (divided)

Definitely use a food processor for the sake of texture. The oats are more enjoyable when turned close to flour. And the beans will be a secret ingredient if you blend them into such small pieces that no one can distinguish them in these moist, fudgy brownies. [(Are you surprised we can use a food processor offgrid? Phillip rocks.)](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/05/using-solar-electricity/)

We adapted this recipe from the [Inglenook Dessert cookbook](https://www.brethrenpress.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=9027) which we highly recommend.

This is for an 8x8 pan in a 350 oven, or if you live in a van/don't have an oven, bake as best you can.

Process all ingredients (except chocolate chips) until completely smooth. Use a blender if you don't have a food processor.

Stir in 2/3 c chips and pour into pan.

Sprinkle remaining 1/3 c chips on top.

Bake ~15 minutes (to taste).

Cool before cutting. If they're too gooey, put them in the fridge. Of if you live offgrid and it gets cold at night, just wait.
