The parish church for Our Lady of Guadalupe in [Puerto Vallarta](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/29/my-kind-of-puerto-vallarta/) is enchanting, though it's relatively plain. Apparently Catholic missionaries focused time and money inland, and this coastal church is only 100 years old - compare that to [Morelia's Cathedral](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/24/festival-del-organo/) (built from 1660 to 1744) or the [church with the Shrine to the Virgen](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/13/rockets-for-la-virgen/) which is...older - but I can't find dates on it. Definitely grander - [check out photos.](https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&pb=!1s0x842d0e0ecba763e5:0x38a9e06f126f0893!2m22!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i20!16m16!1b1!2m2!1m1!1e1!2m2!1m1!1e3!2m2!1m1!1e5!2m2!1m1!1e4!2m2!1m1!1e6!3m1!7e115!4shttps://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrA15KV0O51R_QXcOCN2UNXAaGpizi2cjT4xDK%3Dw241-h160-k-no!5sshrine+of+our+lady+of+guadalupe+morelia+-+Google+Search&imagekey=!1e10!2sAF1QipNrA15KV0O51R_QXcOCN2UNXAaGpizi2cjT4xDK&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwin8crh7MPfAhWYHzQIHQ0GCpkQoiowDnoECAQQBg)

In Puerto Vallarta the church is simple, so the grand crown, windows and that sweet spiral *stand out!*

The inside is extra gaudy (by my taste) at Christmastime.

Approaching the church is exciting - energy of flags and the self-appointed guard yelling at the drunk guys on the steps. We figure they spend all day in this exchange; we all need purpose in life.

I told Phillip he couldn't come into the church since I believed the sign saying (paraphrase) "This is a house of worship, don't come in wearing shorts, swimsuits, tanktops, miniskirts...." Phillip was wearing shorts (and you thought a miniskirt?!) but when I got inside I saw that nearly everyone was wearing shorts, and some people had popsickles (food and drinks were also prohibited).

Beach towns and rules have a loose relationship.
