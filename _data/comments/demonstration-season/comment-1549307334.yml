  My very uninformed impression is that at least two things are normal here:<br>
  1. problems to march/demonstrate about<br>
  2. people lifting their voices<br>
  
  but plenty of people here have no respect for demonstrators and think it's all a waste of time (and complain about traffic). Class and culture are definitely part of this dynamic, since if your main concern in a day is getting somewhere on time, you complain about the demonstration. If your main concern is food and safety for your family, you join the demonstration.<br>
  
  Huge oversimplification!<br>
  
  There are other marches that are more diverse, esp in Mexico City, related to abortion, disappeared students, etc.
