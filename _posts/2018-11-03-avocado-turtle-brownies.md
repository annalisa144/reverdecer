title: Avocado turtle brownies
---

These brownies are a great way to add nutrients to dessert - and you won't taste the avocado at all.

**Brownies**

2 large ripe avocados
8 oz dark chocolate, chopped (depending on the % cocao you use, adjust sweetener to taste)
3 T coconut oil, olive oil or butter
3/4 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 t vanilla
¾ cup flour of your choice
¼+ cup cocoa powder
½ t baking powder
½ t salt
1 c caramel sauce (see below)
1/2 c pecans, toasted

**Directions**

Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C) and place a rack in the middle.
Line 8x8-inch baking pan with greased foil or wax paper. 
Heat butter/oil and chopped chocolate in a medium size heatproof bowl, either in double boiler fashion or 30 sec rounds in a microwave. Stir with a wooden spoon until chocolate and butter/oil are completely melted. Cool for a few minutes.
Mash avocado until very smooth with spoon or in food processor or blender.
Stir in chocolate mixture.
Whisk in sugar until combined, then add eggs and vanilla.
Combine cocoa powder,flour, baking powder and salt, then add to batter.

Spread into pan.

Press spoonfuls of caramel sauce into brownie batter, reserving 1/3.

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until toothpick comes out clean (or wet if you prefer underbaked brownies).

Cool, then sprinkle pecans over brownies and drizzle remaining caramel, then cut.

**Caramel**

1 can (13-14 oz) full-fat coconut milk OR 1/2 c milk/half-and-half + 3 T butter
½ cup honey, maple syrup or sugar
Pinch of salt

1 T olive oil, coconut oil or butter
2 t vanilla

**Directions**

In a medium saucepan with a thick bottom combine first three ingredients.

Bring to boil over medium-high heat. Lower the heat to medium-low and let reduce for about 35 minutes, stirring every now and then.

Add remaining ingredients and cook for further 5 minutes.

It may take more or less time depending on your stove and pot. Stir and scrape the bottom. Some burning will be tasty, but not much. Most importantly, don't let anything stick to the bottom for long.
Remove from the heat and cool for at least 5 minutes, then stir until smooth and glossy.
