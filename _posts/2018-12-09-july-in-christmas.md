title: July in Christmas
---

I've heard of Christmas in July, but we're living July in Christmas.

All summer I was bummed that it was chilly, rainy and back in IN, PA, MN, etc, everyone had heat!

Now, in Decemeber, we're getting summer! It is chilly at night, but heats up so fast - much faster than it did in the rainy season.

It's fun to get my t-shirts and skirts back out from when I packed them away in May.

More rewarding is to pick and eat this whole salad (photo above) from our gardens.
