message: "You know, I'm just not a good napper! Every once in awhile when it got quite hot in the morning I had a chance to nap, but not really now. But I wonder if I could learn how. I think about all the scientific findings about lack of sleep and disease. Gees.\r\n\r\nCitronella is a good idea! We have a couple tiki-type torches with citronella but can't use those in the van - but we could put one right outside the door. And we bought a citronella plant today and can start making some things with that!"
