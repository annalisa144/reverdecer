  Since we installed the pure sine inverter we've had plenty of power. In fact
  now I forget to start the van every few weeks and one time the starter battery
  was dead. Fortunately we can easily jump the starter battery from the solar
  battery. I have two more electricity blog posts in the works to explain more.
