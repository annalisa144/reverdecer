Phlilip made this simple pazzive solar water heater. He dug and leveled a 3" deep pit, lined it with plastic and styrofoam, and now we can scoop out warm (or even hot) water most afternoons.

But most days we don't bother, since it's inconvenient - takes a tiny bit more work and perhaps one more minute than getting water out of the rain tank. Should a minute and some scoops matter? Probably not.

Of course, there are also lots of drowned bugs in it. I know they get hot enough that it doesn't "matter" but it's off-putting.

When it gets too buggy Phillip cleans it out and starts fresh. He's a trooper.
