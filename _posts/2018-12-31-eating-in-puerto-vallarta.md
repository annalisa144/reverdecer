We've been eating at "home" with our friends most meals, and that is fabulous. Turkey, stuffing (not what you'd stuff a turkey with at Thanksgiving, but what you'd stuff a pepper with), Christmas salads all on Christmas Eve. A feast day of *camar√≥n crudo* (raw shrimp, which Phillip found out he is allergic to), fish tacos, salsas, etc was another highlight.

Serious seafood treat was Tacon de Marlin. It was our first time eating marlin and we whole-heartedly approve.

We had brunch at Fredy Toucan, which may tell you it's the best breakfast in town. It was good, but not as good as Angelica and Octavio's eggs with tortillas, beans and salsa at home.
