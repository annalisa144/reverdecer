Morelia has a couple unique annual festivals, including [guitar](http://sic.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=festival&table_id=521), [film](https://moreliafilmfest.com/en/) and organ. The international film fest probably draws the most famous people, but the [Internacional Festival de Órgano](https://www.festivaldeorganodemorelia.org/) is the oldest.

The setting, the cathedral of Morelia, is grand enough for even a boring concert.

And the first concert we attended was a struggle to enjoy since it started at 9pm. But the second (also at 9pm) was fantastic. Luc Ponet can play.

[Sharon captured it best](https://www.facebook.com/sharon.e.winget/posts/10213070612068488), as usual!

The organist sits up in the balcony, so a screen in the front showed a non-crooked-neck view. But I mainly "watched" the ceiling.



Even a late night concert is followed by *cena* in this world, so I had [tlacoyos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlacoyo) for the first time. These were made with blue corn and they were fantastic.
