Some yards are green all winter long in Morelia, but we're not interested in spending time or money that way. The only thing we faithfully water (every 2 days) are [our contrabands.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/02/13/contraband-rhubarb/)

Survival of the thirsty, yet resilient, means daily veggie doses of tomato and kale - even a bizarrly drought tolerant butter lettuce!

We've had gardens ugly with repurposed-trash-mulch

And gardens overgrown with weeds (some edible)

Some not (at least not without practice, like this nightshade)

Overgrown these days is sparse, so it's easy to find the tomatoes. But they hold on tight to the vine! Most of them fall apart if I try to pluck them off, and once I've squished one, I go ahead and eat it. These drought tomatoes are concentrated with taste.
