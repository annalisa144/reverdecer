  Yeah, huge difference! Just think what another month or two of rain will do!
  It's actually about time to mow/weed whack, since we haven't managed to get
  goats or sheep. A scythe would be ideal but we'd have to buy one, and there's
  already a weed-whacker thing here. So that's where we'll start. And once the
  plants dry they'll be great mulch.
