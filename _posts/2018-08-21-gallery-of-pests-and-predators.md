Our garden's most UNwanted pests (I think - please correct what I got wrong):

| [![](/images/pests/aphids_.jpg)](/images/pests/aphids.jpg) | [![](/images/pests/ants_.jpg)](/images/pests/ants.jpg) | [![](/images/pests/bugs_.jpg)](/images/pests/bugs.jpg) |
|  aphids  |    fire ants or other stinging ants  |  assortment of bugs on our rain tank - who do you see?  |


| [![](/images/pests/millipede_snail_.jpg)](/images/pests/millipede_snail.jpg) | [![](/images/pests/grubs_.jpg)](/images/pests/grubs.jpg) | [![](/images/pests/caterpillar_.jpg)](/images/pests/caterpillar.jpg) |
|  millipede and tiny snail  |  gallinas ciegas  |  some caterpillar? looks menacing  |


|  [![](/images/pests/moth_.jpg)](/images/pests/moth.jpg)  | [![](/images/pests/grasshopper_.jpg)](/images/pests/grasshopper.jpg) | [![](/images/pests/bug_shell_.jpg)](/images/pests/bug_shell.jpg) |
|  this moth doesn't look beneficial  |  grasshopper  |  what was this bug?  |


| [![](/images/pests/parasite_.jpg)](/images/pests/parasite.jpg) | [![](/images/pests/bindweed_grasshopper_.jpg)](/images/pests/.bindweed_grasshopperjpg) | [![](/images/pests/gravel_.jpg)](/images/pests/gravel.jpg) |
|  mistletoe-type parasite, a pest in trees and bushes, not garden  |  bindweed and grasshopper  |  [gravel drowning](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/06/level-ground/)  |


| [![](/images/pests/dogs_.jpg)](/images/pests/dogs.jpg) | [![](/images/pests/gris_.jpg)](/images/pests/gris.jpg) |  [![](/images/pests/tapeworm_.jpg)](/images/pests/tapeworm.jpg) |
|  any of the dogs can hurt the garden but Puki and Luna are the heaviest  |  Gris treats the gardens as a litter box  |  and leaves tapeworms  |
