I wondered when we would [get our Mexico bodies back](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/12/getting-our-mexico-bodies-back/), by which I mean, our living-in-a-van-in-a-field bodies, because a person can live in Mexico without being filthy or injured. But that's not how we do it.

From [cactus trauma](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/11/prickly-pears/) to [scorpion stings](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/06/26/picadura-escorpion/) my body has been infiltrated and invaded and here is a gallery of my current injuries:

|  Getting stuff from under the bed (vanlife is rough)  |  Stabbed by a seed pod while strolling |

We carried buckets of bricks home from a trash pile, and these are the places the buckets kept bumping me

| Even my shoes are injured! Those sneakers may retire soon.  |  A cactus thorn spent a week in that pinky, so sore! |

| The sale on wine was for 2 bottles, but then those bottles bumped together in the grocery bag.  |  Cactus splinters |

 I'm surely [aging prematurely](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/10/26/premature-aging/).
