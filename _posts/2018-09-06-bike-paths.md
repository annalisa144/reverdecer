There are few bike lanes or paths in Morelia. In the city center there are a couple divided lanes for bikes.

But they're short and have never been on my way to anywhere.

There's a long bike path near El Terreno which gets plenty of use, by walkers, bikers, dogs - occasionally horses, 4-wheelers and even cars. Seriously, I watched someone in a compact car use an unofficial access ramp (roadbank) to take the bike lane as a left-turn lane into their neighborhood. They weren't on it more than 200m but that included a steep hill (so if I'd been on my way home already I might not have seen them as I biked down that hill). Tried to grab my phone to get a picture but didn't manage.

We could bike our terrible road, down the [scariest hill](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/01/la-colina-de-la-muerte/), through a neighborhood, and take this bike path to the edge of Morelia. But then we end up on La Huerta which is our absolute **least** favorite place to bike because along with the inevitable potholes,*topes*, aggressive drivers and rarely-used-turn-signals, the traffic moves fast here.

So we bike our terrible road, down the [scariest hill](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/01/la-colina-de-la-muerte/), through a neighborhood and then *one more* neighborhood to use a back road onto La Huerta and spend a little less time risking our lives.

When we stayed at my uncle's house and biked into the center each day [I enjoyed the rides](http://www.annalisagross.com/home/andar-en-bici-en-morelia) and found moving in traffic was common-sensical and not too scary. The worst part was definitely potholes and *topes* because if I fall I'll be roadkill. Traffic is tight here. But at least in the city it's tight and fairly slow.

Back to this long bike path: we do use it when we, first, bike through some fields,

toward UNAM (where my uncle teaches) and then travel up the hill to a hardware store.

And we use this bike path to go to [Presa de Cointzeo], which means uphill for most of the 8km until a big downhill to the lake.

Happily we can pedal on for another 2km until the bike path ends. But someday it *should* go all the way to the fun town of Patzcuaro. If it wasn't for the dogs we might bike to Patzcuaro for a weekend once in awhile - it's a charming place! But they hate bike rides, even in their snazzy trailer. Booker doesn't mind if he gets to [ride in the carry bag](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/13/how-to-hike-with-old-dogs/), but I usually want to put a hand on him when I bike with him in the bag, and Patzcuaro is 50km away.
