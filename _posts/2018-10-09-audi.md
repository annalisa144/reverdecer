While we don't see thrift stores in Morelia, Sundays are a yard sale+flea market+food stalls+resale+corner shop+black market called the Audi.

Oh, the deals! (2 pairs of boots for US$10 - but we live in a van and can't accumulate stuff).

Oh, the crowds! (a strong dose to last us through a few solitary days in [El Terreno](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/02/08/missing-the-green/} with the animals)

Oh, the variety!

The clothes from India cost more than they would at a street market in India - which makes sense, as they've traveled far.

If we were going to live in Morelia longer, I think I'd set up a booth of [knitted items](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/annalisa144) and [sourdough delights](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/02/06/sourdoughs/) - but we're planning to return to the midwest US in April. We'll hit the Audi on future visits to Morelia, better be here over a Sunday.
