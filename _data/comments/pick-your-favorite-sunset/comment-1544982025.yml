  We didn't do any filters or messing with color at all - there have been great sunsets lately! Probably cause the rains are gone, so nothing is washing the pollution out of the atmosphere?
  Nearly all the comments I get on instagram are people/companies looking to get me to follow them or promote them. Oh well:-)
