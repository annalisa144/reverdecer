# Off-grid Solar Types
* Direct Thermal - There are many types of off-grid thermal systems. Some heat air.  [Some heat water.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/06/22/the-evolution-of-showering/)  [Some heat food.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/10/02/solar-dehydrator-2nd-attempt/) We have some of these and want to experiment with more.
* Daylight Drive - This is a name given by [Living Energy Farm](http://www.livingenergyfarm.org/) for systems that run DC motors directly from photovoltaic power without the need for batteries.
* Photovoltaic with Battery - This is the type of system discribed in this post.  The photovoltaic panels charge the batteries while the sun shines, and then the batteries provide electricty day and night.

# Main components

[Photovoltaic Panels](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KI14U5C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=annalisa144-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00KI14U5C&linkId=e555191bc6db835af6aadc4625e6ce9a) - This is where the magic happens. When the sun shines on the panels they produce an electric potential.

Our controller is special becuase it has Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT).  This uses electronic wizardry to use about 30%  more power from the PV panels." %}
