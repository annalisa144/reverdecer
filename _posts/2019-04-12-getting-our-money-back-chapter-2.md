How would we retrieve the $1000 the Mexican government owes us? If you don't know why they have our money, [read episode 1](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/03/18/getting-our-money-back/).

We thought we'd have to make separate trips to Mexico City, each navigating one of the biggest cities in the world in a language we barely speak. We expected semi-rude and overly complicated beauracracy. Our days in Mexico were running out, and we just had to try - $1000! Could we think of it as a potentially-paid trip to Mexico City?

My mom was visiting and we decided to go together, while Phillip stayed home with the animals. On our way to the bus station Mom suggested that she stay with the animals, and Phillip and I could go together and just get it done. Efficient and smart idea! But not the vacation/visit she'd been planning on. [Oh, a mother's love!](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/03/28/vanlife-and-re-wombing/)

We went back to El Terreno and talked through the details of pets, solar electricity, food options. We packed. Finally ready, we called a cab company but couldn't explain how to get to El Terreno in our lousy Spanish. Next we called Ezekiel, a taxi driver who could find the place. An hour later the taxi came, and Ezekiel got us to the bus station (dozens of stalls along the way).

We got to Mexico City at bedtime, and Stan explained how we'd get to the government offices the next day. We took a taxi to the subway and a train to the downtown.

Maybe we'd get our business done and have time to [sightsee](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/05/11/museos-en-ciudad-mexico/)?!

We found the buildings without trouble and dared hope for friendly government officials. Though at least 5 guards at the gate had huge guns, they all said *Bienvenidos* with a smile and helped us find the office we needed. No one rolled an eye at our lousy Spanish. We started to go in the wrong door (having misunderstood some instructions) and a guard fetched and redirected us. We weren't relaxed, but we started to breathe a little deeper.
