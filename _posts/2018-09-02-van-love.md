How does vandwelling impact our love life?

A common (yet rarely asked aloud) question. Well...

How is *your* love life (and/or sex life) impacted by camping?
* Cold, unsatisfying, perhaps rare showers, often too hot or too cold, wearing layers of dirty clothes?
* Sleeping on a less-than-ideal bed? 
* Strange noises around? 
* Not sure how much your sounds travel to the neighbors?
* When you have to bundle up and venture out into the dark to rinse off, use the bathroom, brush your teeth, etc?

How is *your* love/sex life impacted by young children (or needy pets)?
* When they squirm inbetween you in bed?
* When they wake you up to go to the bathroom?
* When they wake you up getting sick?
* When they kept you up late the night before and now you're really tired?
* When they're whiny and hungry NOW?

So the image on this blogpost is pretty accurate - this vandwelling life is full of love, but a whole bunch of it is platonic, family-love. And you know what? We're young. [Our dogs are not.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/05/dog-retirement-home/) We have years for second, third, fourth honeymoons when we've said goodbye to a few of these distractions!
