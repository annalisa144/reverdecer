  Since we're on the road most of the time now, sometimes a post is scheduled to go out when we don't have internet access. So an empty or unfinished post stays up for a while. When we get back online we reschedule it and the post (and comments) hide while we work on it.
  
  Now your first comment looks like it was made before the post. That's fun!'
