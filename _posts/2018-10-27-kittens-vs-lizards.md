I wish the kittens would leave the lizards alone - we like lizards! They eat bugs and [bugs are pretty annoying.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/10/cut-out-the-middle-man/)

But the cats can't help themselves when the crevice swifts start their push-up routine.

I don't know if they eat them or just catch them. Ew. Nature.

The lizards have a strong defensive instinct - this chubby one "hid" for hours when we surprised it!
