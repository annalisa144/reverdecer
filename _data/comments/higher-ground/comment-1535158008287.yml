message: "Actually this time Phillip stayed home too:-)\r\nWe let Max decide if he wants to go or not. But we can't tell him what he's getting into when we head out of the gate. \r\nHe is the most independent by far though, and as happy as he when we get home, he's not distressed while we're gone.\r\nGris and Fly are officially mousers!"
