On a recent bike ride we thought we'd find a different way home, and stumbled into a brick city!

We were tentative at first, thinking we might be trespassing in some little village. Well, not really trespassing, since there is a [freedom to roam](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/22/the-right-to-roam/) here. But still, we were on a narrow dirt road and didn't see anyone around.

Then we realized the houses were actually bricks drying with tarps. And then we saw the chimneys were brick kilns.
