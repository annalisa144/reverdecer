That [scary hill](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/02/la-colina-de-la-muerte/)! Here's a taste of driving home from the city - sorry for the chipmunk voices, but I didn't think you'd want to sit through it at normal speed.

Not gonna miss [mildew](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/03/11/mildew/) and all the other messes that we can't easily clean (including [my feet](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/12/getting-our-mexico-bodies-back/), [Max's poop in our bed](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/11/clean/), invisible and revolting [fly residue](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/02/01/fly-catching/) in and on our whole lives.

We won't miss the solitude...until we do...how many weeks of city life before we miss these lonely mountains?

We will *never* miss mice heads underfoot, presents from the kitties in the morning.
