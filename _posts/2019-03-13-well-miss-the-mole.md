Mole sauce makes our black beans never get old. Well, ask Phillip if that's really true. I've been [leaving him alone](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/03/10/feliz-cumpleanos/) a lot lately with vast quantities of rice and beans in the freezer (mole is the best way to dress them up).

[Mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_sauce) (moh-lay, not the rodent) is savory, sweet, salty, umami...and which fabulous flavor stands out depends on the style of sauce. All moles have chili peppers, spices and nuts/seeds/bread crumbs. Usually mole has dried fruit and herbs, perhaps tomoatoes or tomatillos - and often chocolate! If you've ever tried Cinncinati chili you know chocolate is a clever addition to savory sauce.

I assumed mole, like guacamole, was named for the [*molcajete*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molcajete) (mortar and pestle, basically). Though it is the right tool, the "mol" in guaca/mole doesn't come from *molcajete* but from[ "sauce" *molli.* ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/molcaxitl)

*Molcajete* is to mortar and pestle as cast iron is to other skillets. Don't grind chai spices after you've made guacamole, unless you like garlic chai.
