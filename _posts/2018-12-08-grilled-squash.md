I scratched this squash [getting it out of the tree,](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/06/chayote-culling/) so we decided to eat it the same day (big strain on the cooler's cooling capacity to store it there).

It tasted fine raw, but we knew it could get better, so decided to grill it. After a marinade of olive oil, rice wine vinegar, ginger and salt.

Then onto the grill for about 8 minutes per side. More oil would've helped, since I put whole slices on and the center's seedy, stringy part stuck behind. I'm still learning to use the grill part of [our grill](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/08/our-grill/), since growing up mostly vegetarian, we never practiced grill arts. But it's a tasty way to eat vegetables.

Tasted great! We had it for lunch and again for dinner.
