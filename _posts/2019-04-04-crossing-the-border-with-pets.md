Ever crossed an international border with pets? If you were driving, you probably faced more scrutiny about produce and cheese than your pets. Flying is a totally different reality.

We researched how to properly cross the border with pets, and found slight variations on the guideline to bring official paperwork for each pet certifying health. When we talked to  US vets we found a couple approaches:

* outsource the paperwork and charge over $1000 per pet
* say they simply can't do it
* require the pets become patients (so charge for an initial exam) and charge an additional ~$200 per pet

We decided to take copies of their vaccines and hope for the best. Especially since border agents rarely ask for the paperwork - how dismal would that be after spending $4000 for it?!
