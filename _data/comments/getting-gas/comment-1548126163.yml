  You might be able to see from the first picture that about half of the line was downhill. So on that part I didn't run the engine at all. I was really slow, careful with no power steering or boosted brakes.
  
  When I got to the uphill portion, I alternated leaving the engine running every other wait between the line moving forward.  That was trying to balance keeping the battery charged and burning gas.  A Prius would be so much better for this situation.
  
  Five gallons filled the tank, so I don't think I burnt too much waiting in line. We wanted a full tank to go see the monarchs since we had no idea if we would find gas along the way. The funny thing was out in the middle of nowhere we pulled up to a gas station that wasn't blocked off with ropes or barriers. The workers were playing cards.  We tentatively asked if they had gas, and the said something like "yes, of course."  So we filled the tank again -- this time with no wait.
