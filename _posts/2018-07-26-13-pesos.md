Someday we'll have a bike delivery business. We imagine selling coffee on beaches or in parks. But maybe we'll bike around 20 flavors of ice cream, like guys here do. Usually with a moped or motorcycle, which is reasonable given the weight of ice and the mountainous roads.

The horse farm next door has a bunch of kids around during the summer so the local ice cream bike has been stopping by with a tell-tale bell.

Phillip's introversion is overwhelmed by his desire for ice cream, and he brings us back $.50 worth of cafe ice cream. The cone bowl was delicious, too.
