title: Toileting and vanlife

I prefer to pee into empty containers while we're making progress on a roadtrip than stop for public (germ-ridden) bathrooms. Timesaver, esp since my small bladder requests relief every 2 hours.

The cats quickly learned to use their litterbox on our recent roadtip, and we shared one toilet area: behind the passenger seat, the only "open" space in the van.
