  As a daughter, I came to feel some resentment about obligation to do something on Mother's Day for my mother, I'm sad and somewhat embarrassed to say. Therefore at one point I told my daughters that they were absolved from any sense of responsibility to do something for me on that day. In spite of that, almost every year, I get two cards from Global Women's Project, letting me know that my daughters have donated money in honor of me: really the best gift of all!!!
  And I won't deny that I enjoy when some tangible gift shows up as well :-).
  How great to make the connections with chocolate and flowers. Other than coming from far away, does coffee also get a bad rap? :-)
