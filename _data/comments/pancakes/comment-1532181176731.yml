  Yes, just the two of us. We invited Arlene and Kay. Arlene didn't have time
  and Kay had a noon appt and was afraid we wouldn't be done in time (we of
  course tho't that brunch at the Bluebird was an essential part of the outing).
  As per usual, we saw friends there: Carolyn Bollinger, Marie Willoughby, Elsie
  Duffy (who also went to the Bluebird afterward). There were scads of people
  there; what a joyful place!
