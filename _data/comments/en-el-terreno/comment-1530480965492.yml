message: "agreed! they love it, it suits them perfectly, except Max would prefer we move our bed to ground level - we have to get him in and out of the van, and on and off the bed. poor stiff guy!\r\ntoday a neighbor dog came over (squeezed under the gate, clearly not the first time) and the guys loved him. Hannah barked and tried to chase him off, a totally novel action for her! I wonder what the deal is? he came back later and she still isn't sure about him... he's totally sweet as far as I can tell."
