These days we're eating squash pancakes, which means we get vegetables and comfort food in the same bite.

Add cooked, pureed squash to all sorts of things - bread, soup, [apple crisp](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/27/how-to-make-apple-crisp-in-a-grill/)....just wait til we try it in brownies! You might prefer peeling and seeding the squash but we don't bother - you might notice tiny pieces of seeds but they blend in well with oats, nuts, chia seeds and other healthy pancake options. That is, when we're using young squash (think summer squashes like zucchini). If we're using butternut, acorn or another hard skin squash, we'd at least partially peel it.

Beat together:
* 1 to 2 eggs (use 2 if you use more squash to hold the whole thing together)
* 1 cup of milk (or yogurt, buttermilk, sour milk)
Then add:
* 1/2 to 1 cup pureed squash

Mix separately:                [(even simpler, use our mix recipe)](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/17/pancakes/)
* 1 cup flour
* 2 t baking powder
* 1 t cinnamon
* pinch of salt

Mix wet and dry and add:
* 1/2 cup blueberries (or other fruit or treat)

This recipe feeds the two of us. Pancakes are one of our favorite meals since our recipe range is narrowed by cooking only with a [portable grill.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/08/our-grill/)
