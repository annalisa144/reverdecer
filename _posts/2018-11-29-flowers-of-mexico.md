In the part of central Mexico where we're living we see some of the same flowers that we know from the midwest US, like daisybush.

We see flowers where we don't expect them - has your aloe ever bloomed?

What about spiderworts or lion's ear?

Finally, these beautiful flowers are called mosquito flowers, and I do see the resemblance. Unfortunately they don't dissuade the bugs - how cool would that be?
