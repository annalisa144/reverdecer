Phlilip made this simple pazzive solar water heater. he dug and leveled a 3" pool, lined it with plastic and styrofoam, and we can scoop out warm (or even hot) water most afternoons.

But most days we don't bother, since it's inconvenient - takes a tiny bit more work and perhaps one more minute than getting water out of the rain tank. Should a minute and some scoops matter? Probably not.
