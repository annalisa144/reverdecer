Here are some ways you can support this blog and our projets.

First is whenever you are going to buy something from Amazon first click on our of our affiliate links, and we'll get a little kick-back.   For example click the link for our [solar shower  bags](https://amzn.to/2uMP6nF). You don't even have to buy the bags, just use the link to get to Amazon.

The second way is to try out the [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/ann105).   This browser is similar to Chrome, but is even faster because it disables annoying advertising and analytics scripts from running.  Instead it adds a system for directly supporting websites you like.  Use the link above and they'll start you out with $5 of tokens to give away to your favorte websites.
