We're learning to heat with salt. Had never occurred to me, but it works offgrid to keep our toes from becoming ice cubes overnight.

# Why is this better than heating with wood?

There is no fire.  The bottle gets warm, but not hot enough to start a fire. It doesn't consume oxygen or release smoke. This makes it much safer to use in a small, enclosed area like a van.
