  I am working on getting used to Stevia.  In my reading I have found another
  sweetener option, Xylitol, which is a fruit alcohol and also low glycemic
  impact.  I like it much better because it tastes like sugar, at least in my
  tea. I haven't tried baking with it, but it looks like sugar, so bulk-wise is
  probably similar
