Anyone have a favorite diy cat carrier?

Our cats hate going places in the truck and we don't like to see them stressed out.

What if they escape as we open the door at the vet? We might never see them again, between the loose dogs, traffic and other dangers of the street.

We've tried a bag but it wasn't firm enough on the bottom and they opened it anyway.

We don't want to buy two hardcase carriers which we won't have room to bring back to the US, so a cardboard option could make sense. I considered my suitcase, but we can't zip it all the way (oxygen) and if we don't zip it all the way I'm sure they'll get out. Plus they'll hate being stuffed in a suitcase!

Of course, once Fly gets her license I think they'll enjoy the truck more.
