The simple life is usually [complicated](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/18/stuff-we-have-to-do-before-breakfast/). Living without [grid electricity](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/20/electricity/) and [plumbing](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/15/why-does-it-take-so-stinkin-long-to-wash-the-dishes-around-here/) means extra time and effort. Doing with*out* means a lot of *doing.* Of course, we could eschew laptops, phones, [internet](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/01/how-to-get-wifi-from-over-1-kilometer-away/), e-books, but giving ourselves those perks takes far less time than [living without plumbing](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/01/how-to-get-wifi-from-over-1-kilometer-away/)!

I compare our life to the farm where I grew up, or our Amish neighbors in Indiana or Pennsylvania, and there are similarities. But smart Amish strategies include:
* have a bunch of kids who help with the work
* don't run a [dog retirement home](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/05/dog-retirement-home/)
* work together in community
* [don't let animals keep you awake all night](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/10/cut-out-the-middle-man/)

and we don't live that way. We share meals and friendship with the neighbors, and have [bartered](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/31/pools-for-pears/) a little, but we're so weary from [trying to be/speak/travel in Morelia](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/28/time-is-not-on-our-side/) that for us, the simple life usually means staying on the land.

If it was *just* the language barrier, or *just* the roads, or *just* the animals we'd engage the city, the people, much more. But we've learned a lot about our limitations -- and our limits -- from these five months in Mexico. Good learning that will serve us lifelong, which reminds us to appreciate our loved ones (wherever they are!), and brings us closer together.

We came to Mexico temporarily - a year? two? We knew we weren't going to make our whole lives here when nearly everyone we care about is in the US.  Naturally, it turns out, that limits how much energy we can find to build a vibrant social life or practice Spanish.

I've finally stopped beating myself up about all that, and I'm enjoying the simple pleasures of [hikes in our neighborhood](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/22/the-right-to-roam/), caring for this piece of land, staying in touch with friends from afar, and reading and writing.

Here's what Puki, Hannah and I got to witness this morning. What a complex and stark gift!
