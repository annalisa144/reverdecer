  My very uninformed impression is that at least two things are normal here:
  1. problems to march/demonstrate about
  2. people lifting their voices
  
  but plenty of people here have no respect for demonstrators and think it's all a waste of time (and complain about traffic). Class and culture are definitely part of this dynamic, since if your main concern in a day is getting somewhere on time, you complain about the demonstration. If your main concern is food and safety for your family, you join the demonstration.
  
  Huge oversimplification!
  
  There are other marches that are more diverse, esp in Mexico City, related to abortion, disappeared students, etc.
