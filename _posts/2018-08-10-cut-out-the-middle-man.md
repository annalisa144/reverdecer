Thankfully, Max is better (for now) and sleeping through the night! Poor old fella has gastritis and when it flares up he pukes. A lot. We wake up to wretching and one of us bolts quickly and carefully out from under a couple kittens and a couple dogs to pick Max up gingerly (he's sore all over). We have to both crawl (under the low van ceiling) and not land on any animals. It's ridiculous and we'll definitely get a taller van for our next home. Usually we can get Max outside before anything comes out.

But even without Max's wake-up alarms, we're not sleeping much. Between the cats, storms and mosquitos we're awake and annoyed throughout the night.

First, the cats won't come in just cause it's our bedtime, so we have to leave the door open for them (more mosquitos). If we close the door the cats bang on the windows and jump on the roof, looking for a way in. Anyone have experience adding cat doors to vehicles? When we open the door for the cats ti scares them away, so then we start over. When we do get the cats in, they wake us up in the night to play and snuggle.

We are using a mosquito repellant that works pretty well...when we can get it to burn.

[It's this style](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C869L83/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=annalisa144-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07C869L83&linkId=b774371b18247db12f46a7a1831d2b0f), but much cheaper when we buy them at Waldo's a dollar store chain in Mexico. Of course, they don't burn very well...

Luckily we have this metal plate left behind from taking seats out of the van, so we have a relatively safe place for fire in the van. And we have a fire extinguisher, too!

I really want to cut out the middle man (me). I'm covered in mosquito bites and cat scratches - why can't the cats just scratch the mosquitos and everyone leave me alone?

Anyone have experience with [mosquito repelling bracelets](
