Going to Los Azufres is like going home to central PA. The only thing missing is all our Stone Church friends!

Though I never saw geothermal power plants in Pennsylvania. Thanks to an inactive volcano there are [geysers to harvest](http://www.annalisagross.com/home/geothermal) and hot springs to enjoy.

With dogs, we prefer to simply stroll and share air with the trees.

I will always thank mountains for breaking the rules as we travel through clouds, like when [we hike up our hillsides on the right sort of misty, moody day.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/10/12/what-planet-is-this/)
