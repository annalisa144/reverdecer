  My first year in grad school, when I was carless and far from any laundromats,
  I washed all my laundry in the bathtub. I'm sure that I had it easy compared
  to you: my primary occupation was sitting at a desk all day, not getting very
  dirty; I had no pets (thus, no dog pee or puke); I had running hot water. And
  probably when I made my monthly-or-so trip home to visit my parents, I took
  dirty sheets and towels. I'm reminded by European family members that people
  used to change clothes only once a year. No desire to return to that!
