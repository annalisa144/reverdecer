There are myriad challenges when living in a van with pets. Like infestations

and losing our lunch

and over-crowding

But the element of van life with pets that I want to explore in this post is **the mattress.**

[We don't get much sleep with these bedfellows anyway](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/14/i-sleep-with-six/), so we at least want to be comfortable in whatever space we can find in the bed. We haven't found a mattress that really works, yet.

A traditional mattress is most comfortable on our [metal frame bed](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/11/13/best-bed-when-you-sleep-in-a-van/), but doesn't work for converting the bed to a couch - and that's essential because otherwise we can't sit up comfortably in the van.

We used [inflatable sleeping pads for months](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0776VP23C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=annalisa144-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0776VP23C&linkId=41acd63817e50c8702a7450701341cba), and even though Phillip occasionally had to patch a hole, we were generally comfortable. I'd expected them to slide over each other and require frequent resituating, but this wasn't a problem. They were expensive and high-quality (and would have been worth it).

The kittens pounced into our lives and soon Phillip was patching every day - but the slippery side of the pads doesn't hold a patch. Eventually we couldn't keep the pads blown-up for 8 hours, and we started over.

At 4", [this mattress topper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071JGCCY4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B071JGCCY4&linkCode=as2&tag=annalisa144-20&linkId=89a15d2144602cea710f7415631c3c41) sounded like it would be thick enough to use as a mattress. Phillip is comfortable, but I notice the tines of the bed frame sometimes. But cats can't deflate it and it stays in place as a couch, with occasional yanks (like you'd do with a futon pad in couch position).

Turns out the mattress isn't really a full queen (see video below - it never grew to size)? Or not the same queen-size we've had before? Because there are gaps on the sides and top and/or bottom, which worries me for Max, since he might end up breaking a leg getting in and out (think about him sliding through that bedframe).

But we've had it for months without injury.

A [mattress cover](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JIV5YES/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01JIV5YES&linkCode=as2&tag=annalisa144-20&linkId=5e1d46b315ed884fd7c92499d7f48fd6) as an overall bed cover makes a big difference with all our muddy paws, Max's poopy butt, Hannah's dirty face (from burying bones)....

This won't last forever.
