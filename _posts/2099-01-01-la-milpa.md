The three sisters have so many siblings!

Have you heard of three sisters gardening? Corn+beans+squash, companion-planted so that the beans climb corn, squash mulches the bed, beans fix nitrogen for corn, squash blossoms attract pollinators, etc. When gardeners and farmers look into relationships between plants their harvest grows and the soil smiles.

I've heard people talk about as many as 12 sisters, and I'm planning a family reunion! Right now we have the traditional three sisters together in a four different beds, with their relatives nearby. But my next round of planting will have more complexity. You can see in the photo above that one of our three sisters beds is huge but nearby, two are tiny. The biggest is in a sunnier spot which the corn are loving, but the beans and squash are growing more slowly.

In Morelia many people have no idea what this is (it's a big city; imagine asking in Indianapolis about three sisters gardening...) though Central America is where the practice was developed.  And in Spanish it's often called [la milpa](https://viaorganica.org/la-milpa-del-buen-comer/).

Google translates "milpa" as "cornfield," but of course it's much more:
