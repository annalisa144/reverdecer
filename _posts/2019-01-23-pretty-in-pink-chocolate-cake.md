We've got a new favorite adult chocolate cake recipe (though we still love [this one,](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/01/11/best-chocolate-cake/) too).

We adapted the recipe from Simone Balder's book [Cupcakes with a Kick](https://www.skyhorsepublishing.com/9781510730212/cupcakes-with-a-kick/).

CAKE
* 1 cup of your preferred fat: butter, olive oil, coconut oil. etc (we used olive oil and butter)
* 3/4 cup sugar (originally 1 cup, you know how sweet you like things)
* 4 eggs 
* 1 t vanilla extract 
* 2 1/4 cups cake flour 
* 1/2 t salt 
* 2 t baking powder 
* 1/2 cup red wine (we used Merlot) 
* 2 T-1/2 cup cocoa powder (depending on how intensely chocolate you're craving)
* 2 T red wine for soaking into cake once baked 

ICING 
* 1 cup blackberries (if frozen, defrost in advance) and set aside ~20 whole blackberries (pick out the prettiest ones) 
* 1/2 cup red wine 
* 1/3 cup butter (or other fat)
* 2 cups sifted confectioner's sugar

1. Preheat your oven to 350F and line 
24 cupcake molds or muffin tins with 
paper liners, or prepare 9x9 pan.

2. Cream butter, sugar and eggs 
until smooth and creamy. 
Add the vanilla and mix well again. 

3. In a separate bowl sift the flour, salt 
and baking powder together and add to 
the creamed wet mixture. Add the red 
wine and combine but take care not to 
overmix. Finally, add the cocoa pow- 
der and beat one last time. 

4. Using a large spoon, carefully fill 
each of the cupcake liners to about 3/4â€” 
full or pour into cakepan. Bake until a 
toothpick inserted into the center of the 
cupcake comes out clean. Leave to cool 
slightly for about 5 minutes before 
turning out onto a rack. 

(If you're [baking in a grill](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/10/30/baking-in-a-grill/) and running low on propane, consider finishing the baking in a solar oven/dehydrator.)

5. When the cup/cakes are completely 
cool, brush the 2 T of red wine on top 
of the cakes and allow to soak in. Set 
aside.

6. For icing, place the remaining 
blackberries (after selecting the 
best for decoration) in a saucepan 
together with the wine and bring to a 
simmer. Reduce this until the black- 
berries are very soft and the wine is 
quite syrupy. Remove from the heat 
and sieve the mix, pressing the seeds to 
remove all the juice. This mix should be 
a little less than a 1/4 cup. (I was too lazy 
and just smooshed the berries.)

7. Cream the butter well and gradually 
add the confectioner's sugar. Add the 
blackberry sauce. This icing should be a little 
soft. 

8. Ice, then decorate with berries.
