We'll miss our neighbors (especially the humans, but the dogs, too). We miss [Booker](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/06/booker/) every day, and wish we were taking him home with us. We can't take any [street dogs](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/02/04/butterfly-food/) or [not-Flys](**).

But Fly, Gris, Max and Hannah are officially ready to cross the border.

My last full day in El Terreno was actually March 5, because I've been traveling since then. I'll get back tonight. That last day I spent with dog friends in the hills we've loved to hike, and exploring the aftermath of the [neighborhood wildfire.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/03/08/wildfire/)

I worked in the [messy garden](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/03/04/garden-mess/) and found eggplant we'd never noticed! Wonder if Phillip has eaten them yet? If not, we *are* taking them when we leave tomorrow.
