title: Electricity
---

We don't have electricity here, as in, we're not on the grid. We do have solar panels on the roof of the van and they're enough to charge our laptops, phones and toothbrushes. But not enough to run our freezer, it turns out. Phillip picked out this freezer especially to work with our solar panels and inverter, so we're disappointed. It's using as much as three times the energy it was supposed to. In part because we have a problem in the inverter? In part because we're changing out ice packs a couple times a day to use our cooler as an ice pack?

We turn everything off at night (you know, it's dark, so no power). But now that we're in the cloudy rainy season we don't have enough solar power until afternoon to turn the freezer on. Since we depend on the freezer for ice packs for our cooler (ice box) and have food stored in the freezer too, we've been running the van at least once a day this rainy season.

We're not driving the van (it's holding up a shade cloth and we just don't want to take it out on the rough road until absolutely necessary) so when we run out of gas in the van we bring it in a can. Neighbors' trash ends up in este terreno a menudo and recently we found a funnel - thanks, neighbors:-)

Phillip is researching options: new panel, different inverter - even a different freezer? Probably the first two soon and leave this freezer in Mexico (it takes up so much space and when we have to cram all our belongings back in here...) and get a new one in the US eventually.

Occasionally we use solar power to grind coffee beans, heat water, humidify the van or use our immersion blender making *chocolate*. Phillip was careful to research what we could plug in and use with this set-up and other than the freezer it's all worked out.

Oh, one more appliance - the little fan Phillip got out of an old computer that helps dry out our toilet.
