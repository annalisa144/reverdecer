Sorry I didn't explain the water heater part - I'm not good at taking a video while scooping water (a two-hand job). Read more about that [here.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/10/10/we-have-a-water-heater/)

Read about the solar dehydrator [here.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/10/02/solar-dehydrator-2nd-attempt/)

And [here's more](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/06/30/rustico/) about the kitchen structure.
