[Our first solar dehydrator](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/19/solar-dehydrator-1st-attempt/) didn't last. [The rainy season has consumed many cardboard/paper items.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/17/our-favorite-mistakes/)

The new one is working alright, not as effective as I'd expected, but getting the job done over 1-2 days (which means, it, too, inevitably gets rained on).

On a sunny day I can usually dry greens in a single day. Then put them through the blender and add to pancakes, pizza dough, tea, etc.

I tried making crackers (well, cracker-type item from radish, almond and spices) and they were still soggy on the 3rd day so I transferred them to the grill and we used them as pizza crust. Wasn't very tasty, but healthier than [our normal pizza crust.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/10/pizza-on-the-grill/)
