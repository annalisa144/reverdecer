Our world is quaking with important news. Families separated while seeking asylum in the US. Two mayoral candidates assasinated in our state of Michoacan ([47 candidates have been murdered this election season](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/two-more-candidates-for-mayor-assassinated/)). So what are people talking about around here?

The World Cup.

We didn't even know the World Cup was happening until we heard that fans jumping for a goal registered as an earthquake in Mexico City. What a fun story! [Turns out it's probably not true:-(](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/06/world-cup-mexico-city-earthquake-explained-science/)

While the election is mostly a joke to the Morelianos I've talked to, they're going to vote anyway. *It's our right, our duty, to vote. Even if we write in "Donald Duck" we vote.*

People generally expect the US to be inhospitable and cruel to migrants and asylum-seekers. People have full faith that electoral politics are corrupt and violent. So why get caught up in the drama? Just enjoy the World Cup. It doesn't work for me, but I do sympathize.
