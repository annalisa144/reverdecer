title: Sink Success!

We're sinking to new heights of permaculture harmony, as close to the easy life as we've ever been here.
We started with this sink system.

We washed hands, dishes, rinsed our toothbrushes, etc, into that tub and then dumped the water on trees. This served some basic needs:
* we didn't create a big mud puddle under the faucet
* we got to water thirsty trees rather than contribute to the erosion here
* we were using our only faucet for everything we could use it for

But it was gross to wash our hands into the dishtub, even though we rinsed it before washing dishes. And the tub took up the only table space we had.

Now we have such luxury! Check out our kitchen "plumbing."

And here's our bathroom sink.
