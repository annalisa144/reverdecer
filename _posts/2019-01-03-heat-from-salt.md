[We have a water heater](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/10/10/we-have-a-water-heater/) and [solar showers](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/06/22/the-evolution-of-showering/). They are all heated directly from the sun. They're wonderful on clear days, but they don't get warm on cloudy, rainy days. This post is about our first experiments with storing heat from the sun to use when it isn't shining. We're learning to heat with salt. Had never occurred to me, but it works offgrid to keep our toes from becoming ice cubes overnight.

# Sidewalk ice melt salt

In places where it snows [Calcium Chloride] is sold in all the big box stores for melting ice off of sidewalks and driveways.

# A little chemistry

Our reserch started with a part of chemestry called [Endothermic/exothermic chemical reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy_storage#Endothermic/exothermic_chemical_reactions). Put simply, an endothermic process absorbs energy to complete, and an exothermic process releases energy to complete.

# Release the heat




# Why is this better than storing hot water in an insulated tank?

Our [sleeping bag](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/21/cooking-in-a-sleeping-bag/) holds hot water for about four hours. A [good, home-built insulated tank](https://www.builditsolar.com/Experimental/PEXColDHW/HeatLoss.htm#TheTest) might store useable heat for a week.  When the heat is stored in chemical form it can be stored almost indefinetly. This lets us **store** the sun's heat on a hot, sunny summer day, then **use** it on a cold, cloudy winter day.


# Why is this better than heating with wood?

There is no fire.  The bottle gets warm, but not hot enough to start a fire. It doesn't consume oxygen or release smoke. Therefore it's much safer to use in a small, enclosed area like a van.

Since there is no smoke, widespread use of this technology would reduce the suffering and deaths of millions of people from respiratory disease. The Global Burden of Disease study estimates that [3.5 million people](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/great-energy-challenge/2012/cookstove-smoke-is-largest-environmental-threat-global-health-study-finds/) die annually from respiratory illness due to burning wood and other biomass.
