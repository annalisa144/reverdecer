  When I first moved to San Antonio, tree donators included instruction to dig a
  hole 2-3 times wider than rootball and amend the soil to fill the hole. The
  watering instructions were to drill holes on a 5 gal bucket and use it to
  water 3-2-1. 3 times weekly the first month, 2 times weekly the second month
  and once weekly the third month. Thereafter the hope was to only water monthly
  that first year. THEN new instructions came a few years later. Dig a hole just
  a bit larger than the size of the rootball. BUT water with the 5gal drip. Just
  outside that ball. So the roots learn to adjust to their native clay or
  caliche soil from the start. When the poor soil has deep watering, it softens
  enough for the roots to go out and down. And the survive longer. It might be
  the same there. In El Salvador, where there is a 6th month rainy time and 6
  mos dry, we were instructed to water a full year at least once monthly,
  deeply. Might there be enough grey water for that on your parcel?
