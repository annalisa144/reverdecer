[When I met this banded garden spider I wondered if, at over 1" body, it might take a grasshopper out of commission.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/07/life-went-on/)

Won't make a dent in the plague, but in a morbid reverse of the starfish fable, I'm glad to see any grasshoppers feeding other creatures, rather than feeding on our plants.
