You're camping, your power's out, you're living in a van in Mexico...you *should* get so much natural sleep that you don't need coffee, right? Ha - [between the animals inside](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/14/i-sleep-with-six/) and storms outside, we're as tired as ever. We drink as much coffee as ever, too.

Here's our method:

1. heat water
2. grind coffee
3. pour over

1. We have two options for heating water: 
**electric kettle** Phillip carefully researched what could run on our solar system (had to be fewer than 800w) and [found this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009USKLQQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=annalisa144-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B009USKLQQ&linkId=7d1278ed0ebcf2b383089b825d8dfebb)

Turns out low-watt kettles are rare, so we had to get one wired for UK, which means we had to buy an [adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0080SE6H2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0080SE6H2&linkCode=as2&tag=annalisa144-20&linkId=e39918fe1e699565a472c4bd174da83b), too

If we don't have enough sunlight we use option 2:
**propane** Our [grill](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0078IMV1S/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=annalisa144-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0078IMV1S&linkId=3042e052551918ab9a623b8075f6dbb7) takes a lot longer to heat water than the kettle, but we're glad to have a back-up plan since coffee desire often arrives before the sun has charged our battery enough to use any electricity.

2. We prefer to buy beans for a fresher cup but our [favorite coffee supplier](facebook.com/pg/CaFe-de-Gaby-1673228209668570) (direct trade from Chiapas) only carries ground, so we usually get to skip this step. Yay!

Our grinder is an [older version of this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005OTXM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=annalisa144-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00005OTXM&linkId=f459143b0d11642e6bfac679f20e0e0a)  and we use it for spices and dry herbs, too. We expect it will last longer than the van. does work with the solar system, though a low battery struggles to get that initial whir of the blades. **Pro tip: any appliance says how many watts it uses, but the initial power surge may be higher.**

3. [Our first pour-over was all-in-one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DH1LB10/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01DH1LB10&linkCode=as2&tag=annalisa144-20&linkId=c332c222fab9252ad458798a6f1459e1) and the coffee always tasted dusty. Phillip faithfully cleaned it using various internet-recommended methods. We read scads of reviews and ended up buying a separate filter and holder. [The filter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MY7OBSS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=annalisa144-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01MY7OBSS&linkId=61c604ccddfba66810935b66c61dd8dd) will last forever and the holder will last until a drop onto our [rough concrete kitchen floor](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/06/30/rustico/).
