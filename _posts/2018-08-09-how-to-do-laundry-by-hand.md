If you live in a van, RV or otherwise without a washing machine, if you're traveling or spill something on your clothes at work, you might need to do laundry the way people have been doing laundry for 99.99% of human history: by hand.

Doing laundry by hand can involve buckets, bags and [washboards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B5FSYR0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=annalisa144-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00B5FSYR0&linkId=c8a57d6dbe1b6e9cc0ae4254ea65d4ec). Or you can just plug a sink or bathtub and use your hands.

We like our [bucket system](https://bestdryingrack.com/hand-washing-clothes.html), though if we had a machine we'd use it in a heartbeat! Our bucket+plunger really is a step above a sink, though:

Benefits:
* the plunger moves water through the clothes with more force than we could do with only our hands so our clothes probably get cleaner
* this is probably gentler on clothes than washboards or machines
* the separator *might* help, but I imagine the dirt is pulled back up through the clothes with the water when I'm plunging. It would be interesting to test this with a clear bucket
* since the plunger is likely the best part of the system, you can [buy that piece alone for $25](https://bestdryingrack.com/hand-washing-clothes.html). [There's a version on amazon, too.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QUAPSO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=annalisa144-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B002QUAPSO&linkId=e01daab00946bd9964894c26fa394fa9)

Bummers:
* it's probably the biggest handwashing laundry option (other than a bathtub or huge basin, which we don't have) but it's still **not** big enough to wash a blanket. We have washed our sheets, one at a time, with reasonable success
* there's no wringing function and our clothes end up so wet that they can easily get stinky before they dry. We can empty the bucket and plunge some more, pour liquid out, repeat, and it helps a little. But this system works if you can hang your clothes out on a sunny day.

Other possibilities out there include the [Scrubba bag](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N68XF0O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=annalisa144-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01N68XF0O&linkId=89d33f4f97ea27111fa2d612817c9f9f) which is wonderfully small for traveling, but too small for even a sheet. At least it seems like it - anyone out there have experience?

I've fantasized about a compact electric option like this but until we get a bigger (or better organized) van, I don't think it's worth the space. That is to say, we'd probably be glad to use it in Mexico (and it *should* run off the solar panels) but once it's time to pack everything up into our van and leave, we might not find room for it.

**Whichever tools and containers, two essential tips**
*  Use as little soap as possible so you don't have to rinse, rinse, rinse, rinse...
*  Wring (by hand or however) as much as you can stand so your clothes have a chance to dry before they stink of mildew.
