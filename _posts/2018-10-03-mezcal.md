Between the festival de mezcal and talking with mezcal producers, we've discovered a few reasons to enjoy it.

* Did you know the whole worm-in-the-tequila/mezcal-bottle was to demonstrate the alcohol content? Makes drinking alcohol seem a little too much like biology lab.
* [Bats are a primary pollinator of agaves allowed to bloom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87rzxT9p2gs) (mezcal/tequila producers usually don't let them bloom, wanting the plant's sugars to stay in the heart or *pi√±a* for turning to alcohol).
* Depending on the variety and setting (namely, shade or sun) of a specific plant, maturity may come  between 7 and 70 years.

Mezcal  is distilled alcohol made from agave, or [*maguey*](http://mezcal.com/en/maguey.php). Tequila is the most famous mezcal (made from agave azul) but in Mexico it's passe. Since tequila is such a hit in the US it is mass-produced with corner-cutting. There's a lot of bad tequila out there.

Artisinal or even ancestral mezcals are in resurrgence.

We've got a ton of agave azul en El Terreno and here are countless agaves on the hillsides where we hike. But I don't think we'll be ambitious enough to harvest any for mezcal (or any of dozens of other uses). Between the spikes and the equipment, I think it's better for the pros. We'll support the local economy.
