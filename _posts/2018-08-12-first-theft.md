When we first moved onto El Terreno [we expected our stuff would get stolen, repeatedly.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/04/17/en-el-terreno/) But we've only had one theft in four months!

Our friends the Khares gave us this beautiful home blessing that we've enjoyed in Indiana, Pennsylvania and now Mexico. [When we moved into a trailer](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/07/were-stuck/) we gave away/stored paintings, stained glass, framed photos and pretty much all of our decoration. But this space-efficient, trailer-friendly bead-and-bell hanging traveled with us from India, even into the van.

[We can't see the gate from the places we spend most of our day (van, kitchen, most of the gardens) so we don't know when people are trying to visit.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/04/19/good-dogs-make-good-neighbors/) We hung this "doorbell" at the gate and people used it! But it was a bit too quiet. Rattling the heavy chain that secures the gate is the best way to let us know you're here (do you feel ready to visit us, now?)

A couple weeks ago we realized the beads-and-bell had been stolen. [The winds can be ferocious](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/05/wind/); couldn't it just be in the ditch? Nope, it's gone for good.

We're certainly sad to lose this charming gift. And we're relieved that no one has broken into the van, [stolen our food or kitchen supplies](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/06/30/rustico/), taken our bikes or messed with the [chicken tractor.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/25/chicken-care/) This was the most convenient item to take, but nothing we own is secure. We had a master plan for hiding valuables - stay tuned to read about that huge flop!
