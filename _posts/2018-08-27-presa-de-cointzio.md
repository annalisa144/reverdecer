Morelia gets water from Lago de Cointzio, controlled by the (dam) Presa de Cointzio. It's a (relatively) peaceful bikeride from El Terreno, mostly by [bike path!](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/26/bike-paths/)

We don't have a drone for this sort of camera footage. At least not yet...so we'll borrow this:

In April the lake looked like a field of soybeans as we coasted into the valley. In August the water lilies aren't as thick - but they are blooming!

The lake is beautiful, but we enjoy it as an excuse for a great bike ride - hard uphill, sweet downhill, then into the conifers - so many that the air is full of sweet sap smell.

Apparently the water supply is running out and perhaps there isn't a plan for where Morelia's water will come from next. We can't tell you more since our Spanish is bad and local journalism is thin. But we will dig some more [swales](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/03/swales/) and hope for the best.
