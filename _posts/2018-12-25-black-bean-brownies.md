Can't think of a better Christmas present than these black bean brownies:
* Gluten-free
* Sugar-free option
* Easily vegan
* No eggs (no worry about underbaking)
* Delicious

(Plus they have hidden nutrients!)

Definitely use a food processor for the sake of texture. The oats are more enjoyable when turned close to flour. And the beans will be a secret ingredient if you blend them into such small pieces that no one can distinguish them in these moist, fudgy brownies.
