Phillip and I are different - personality, strengths, hobbies. We've got plenty of shared values and interests, but we're different enough to get things done. Just think - if we both liked cooking, who would build the solar electrical system?

One person could be good at both of those things. Phillip and I have few overlapping gifts. I prefer it this way, because we don't argue about how to do things, and we get more done.

I've asked him a dozen times how the van's battery and the solar panel battery interact, but I couldn't explain it to you. Each time he tells me, I think I understand. But then I let the information drain out of my brain. Probably because I know he'll take care of it.

And no matter how many times I tell him what food is around to eat, he forgets something. Before I leave him (again!) in El Terreno for 10 days, we inventoried the freezer together. Then I pulled out all the seasonings he might enjoy putting on all that rice and beans.

Phillip can cook, though when we met he only made two meals for himself, and I won't tell you what they were. But he's the one who perfected making pizza on the grill! (Though I do the yeast part.)

He's better at constucting cooking systems:

* [solar dehydrator #2](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/10/02/solar-dehydrator-2nd-attempt/)
* I guess the solar oven never made an appearance on the blog, probably because it didn't work very well 
* [sleeping bag](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/21/cooking-in-a-sleeping-bag/)
*  stay tuned for a post about the big parabola

Back in the US he'll execute a few of those ideas with materials and tools of his choosing. And we'll keep using the sleeping bag.
