All the elements feel more extreme here - the sun is stronger, hotter. Afternoon wind comes in gusts that strew our stuff. Rain is nearly daily now, and at least twice a week it's a thunderstorm.

I think the elements really are extreme, but we also feel them more acutely because we're living in our van. Which means we're mostly living outside and sleeping in the van.

We leave the sidedoor open pretyt much all the time so the dogs can go in and out. And now that we have kittens who realize that the space under our bed is the coolest playground, we keep the van door open so they don't accidentally get separated (we can't see them if they're under the bed).

But I've been anxious about any of our sweet pets getting squished in the heavy van door because when the wind gusts, it blows shut so hard without any warning. So finally we rigged up some bungee cords. We use bungee cords every day in at least a few ways. Right now they're holding the rack on my bike, holding our gravity water filter, etc.
