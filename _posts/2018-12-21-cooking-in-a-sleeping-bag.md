Maybe we have to cook in a sleeping bag cause we're living offgrid and it's December? Can you picture us wrapped up in blankets standing around the [grill](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/08/our-grill/)?

Not a bad idea for breakfast or late dinner, but it's been [hot every fabulous, sunny winter afternoon,](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/09/july-in-christmas/) much hotter than summer! (not the nights, though)

But we've actually developed a way to cook in a sleeping bag that we recommend - even if you have a fully electric life.

We bring beans/rice/veggies/soup to a boil on the grill, then wrap the pot in our sleeping bag and wait. it stays **hot** for hours, even stays warm overnight. Rice gets overcooked easily - we never pull it out soon enough. Beans require a second boil, or even a third. But this is still a vast improvement over cooking beans on the grill - we always seem to run out of propane before the beans get soft, and hours on the grill is a total waste of gas.

We've tried beans in a thermos, too. Bring to boil, then pour into a thermos and wrap that in a sleeping bag. Better than just the pot, still takes two rounds.
