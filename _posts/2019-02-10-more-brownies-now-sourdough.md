Which phrase subtly means "healthy" to you?
* gluten-free
* low fat
* low sodium
* no added sugar
* vegetarian
* with live cultures
* low carb

I've believed in most of those for a time - these days my "let's pretend this makes it healthy" phrase is *sourdough.*

So now we have sourdough brownies, along with [bread](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/02/06/sourdoughs/), [pizza](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/02/05/sourdough-pizza/), [pancakes](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/02/07/sourdough-pancakes/), corn-pepper bread, etc.
