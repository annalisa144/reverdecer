Baking in [our grill](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/08/our-grill/) is disappointing. But we love dessert so we keep trying.

We've made cakes, brownies, [crisps](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/27/how-to-make-apple-crisp-in-a-grill/) and more. 

Baking isn't that different from roasting, which people often do in grills. But those are big grills and big cuts of meat. We have a trim and portable grill, which means baking is nearly impossible. Baking requires indirect heat, and our grill is so tight that it's hard to space without direct heat.

[Pizza](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/10/pizza-on-the-grill/) works fabulously, but that's grilling, not baking.

We've only [sacrificed one dish](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/17/our-favorite-mistakes/) in this learning process.

The [skillet cookie](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/12/skillet-cookie/) is a good work-around, but I think skillet brownies would be dry and disappointing.

The best method is to put batter in as many small dishes as possible so they bake "quickly" but it still takes about twice as long as a normal oven (brownies can take an hour, cake can take two).  We have to open the grill to rotate dishes, which extends the time. But the grill's thermometer quickly reaches 500 when only one burner is on at the absolute lowest. I think the thermometer is inaccurate.

We quickly run out of space since we can't use the lit side, so we can use the lid, to melt caramel sauce, and slowly "bake" some avocado brownies.

I've experimented with a water bath and I think it helps even out the heat (since it's strongly one-sided) but we fill up even faster this way.

We can get a dessert fix without baking via [avocado chocolate "mousse"](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/04/chocolate-avocado-mousse/) or [mallow ice cream](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/29/chocolate-mallow-ice-cream/) and while both are delicious, they aren't hot, gooey brownies. At least [hot chocolate](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/02/how-to-make-chocolate/) is hot!
