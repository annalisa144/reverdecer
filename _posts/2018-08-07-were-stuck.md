title: We're stuck
---

How did we end up living in a van? Well, first we lived in a travel trailer, and bought the 1999 full-size GMC to pull the 18' travel trailer. Then we learned we didn't like moving the trailer from place to place. Packing safely and getting hitched up was a chore, and driving the whole set was stressful. We didn't want to travel with our travel trailer. So we downsized to the van.
