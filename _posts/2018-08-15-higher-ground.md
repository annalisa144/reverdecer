We got fresh perspective by hiking up to the highest point we could find and looking down on our hillside. By then we could see most of Morelia.

There are higher points to reach and since we have great [freedom to roam here](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/22/the-right-to-roam/), we'll keep exploring.
