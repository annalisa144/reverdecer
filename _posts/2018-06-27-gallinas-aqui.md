We got chickens! Phillip built the chicken tractor weeks ago. While Max enjoyed it, we did want chickens to abide within.

We'd been warned to buy young chickens, or else we'd end up with 2+ year-old hens, running out of eggs. Still we didn't want to pay to feed chickens for a few months before getting any eggs out of it. But after months of casual looking we could only find adolescents, 5-weeks-old. In three or more months we'll see some eggs.
In the meantime at least we have someone to enjoy our food scraps! (The dogs still get to lick out bowls and eat pepper stems.)

At least now we have gallinas to eat the gallinas ciegas I dig out of our garden beds! Those yucky grubs the size of my thumb that turn into something in the June bug family. Their favorite food is grass root, but they've infested our root vegetable bed, so I cull between the plants once a week. Oh, I'm so excited for our little chickens!

Phillip built the chicken house as a chicken "tractor" which means we can move it around el terreno and the chickens get new places to scratch and leave behind their nutritious poop. If Hannah doesn't eat it all before the earth does.
