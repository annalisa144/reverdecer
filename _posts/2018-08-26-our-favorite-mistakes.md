Here's a gallery of mistakes we've made:

First time we went to Costco we ended up with a box of sugar packets, rather than a box of sugar. We could blame it on not reading the Spanish carefully, but truly, I made the same mistake in the US years ago!

After opening packet by packet each time I baked for a month or two, I finally got tired of it and sat down with a podcast and opened every single one, pouring the sugar into a container. The packets became mulch in the gardens. No waste!

When we first arrived en El Terreno [we expected to get robbed a lot](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/04/17/en-el-terreno/). So Phillip quickly built a shed and we dug a root cellar underneath for hidden storage. We haven't used it much since [we've only had one theft](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/12/first-theft/) and no one has come onto the land without our knowledge (ha, in our knowledge, you know?)
