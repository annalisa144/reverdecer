We ate at [Karne Garibaldi](http://www.karnegaribaldi.com.mx/), a restaurant in Guadalajara which holds the Guinness Record for the fastest customer service in the world (at a sitdown restuarant, presumably). It was quick service, with expert camareros weaving through the packed dining room.

The food is delicious, too! I like the *botana* (appetizer) *frijoles con elote y totopos.* The main event is *carne en su jugo* which must include beef (*carne*) "in its juice." I noticed crispy pieces of bacon (*tocino*) and what must have been *chorizo*, a multi-animal stew.

Perhaps most record-worthy was the valet staff, cramming (without incident) cars and even our big van into an L-shaped parking lot. But they didn't know how to turn the van on, so Phillip had to get the van back out - I didn't give him a *propina* but was absolutely impressed!
