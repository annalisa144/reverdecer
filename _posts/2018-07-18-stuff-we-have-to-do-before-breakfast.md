* wake up before dawn to Max puking (must've gotten into some cat food yesterday and he's allergic to chicken)
* squeeze between all the dogs and cats to get Max out the door before he throws up on the bed
* wipe some puke off the bed
* try to sleep a little more, listening to the most boring podcast in my queue
* another round of Max puking, this time Hannah wants to go out and pee
* wait for Hannah to come back from roaming so we can close the van door
* give up on Hannah and decide to try to sleep with the door open - there are already mosquitos and flies inside, so does it matter?
* give in to the morning and get out of bed
* carry Booker out since he's leaking a little pee
* brush some dry grass and dirt off the bed and tuck the matress protector over the whole bed - blankets, pillows and all - so when the dogs come back in to nap their muddy paws don't get on the sheets

* brush our teeth
* find a toothbrush charger and finish brushing teeth
* get filtered water for nasal irrigation
* all that other hygeine stuff
* refill [tippy-tap](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/01/sink-success/) jug from rain bucket to finish washing hands
* refill the [solar shower bags](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/06/22/the-evolution-of-showering/) from water tank and put where the sun will warm them if it peaks out from the clouds
* wring out the handtowel from last night's rain and "dry" hands
* refill cat food in the shed (out of Max's reach)
* refill dog food
* put the pet beds out in the sun since it's too cold in the shade still
* feed chickens
* catch and return chicken that escaped during feeding
* give chickens fresh water
* fill five water dishes for cats and dogs
* change the ice packs in the cooler, which means taking half of the stuff out of the cooler and a few things out of the freezer
* turn on the van cause we don't have enough sun to run the freezer off the solar panels
* breathe in disgusting fumes
* wash a few plates cause we had the neighbors over for dinner last night, which means we used all six of our plates, and since they left well after dark we didn't bother to wash up last night
* refill a water bucket from rain tank to finish washing those dishes
* backflush the drinking water filter with clean water
* fill the drinking water filter with rainwater from the tank
* heat water in a pot to make coffee in a pour-over
* start cracking eggs onto the griddle - oh crap, one is rotten
* finish cooking the eggs then feed them to all the cats and dogs
* refill bucket from rain tank again to wash hands after egg incident
* give Booker his medicine in some cheese
* find some kefir to convince Booker to finish his medicine

* pick some kale to add more nutrients to the [pancakes](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/17/pancakes/)
* crack eggs into a dish carefully before using in pancake batter
* keep pouring-over that coffee
* offer Phillip a snack - he's starting to look woozy
* find Fly and try to catch her
* drink a sip of coffee
* try again to catch Fly
* take about five things out of the freezer to get some blueberries for pancakes
* catch Fly and give her eyedrops
* drink a little coffee
* turn on the griddle and start the pancakes
* find a dry outfit for Booker since he's shivering and trying to climb me to get warm
* get a dry outfit for Max, since he's hairless and needs it
* follow Max into a corner since he hides from clothes
* flip the pancakes
* find the butter and maple syrup
* chase flies off the pancake batter

Still, now we're smiling with empty plates and a great view.
