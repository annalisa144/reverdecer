Próspero año nuevo! This is beach season in Mexico, and we've been in [Puerto Vallarta](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/29/my-kind-of-puerto-vallarta/). Even at the height of tourist season, we're finding peaceful playas throughout this bay, and we're fully charmed by the coastal pace and seaside breezes.

Remember, [it's worth finding the ~tilda for the n, because you don't want to wish someone a good new anus.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/21/sun-salutations/)

The best beach we've been to is [Playa Destiladeras](http://visit-vallarta.com/discover/beaches/playa-destiladeras/) (don't know what they distill there). It's actually in Nayarit (state neighboring Jalisco), but on the same bay as Puerto Vallarta. Not only is this gorgeous, mountains along with the ocean, but the beach is long and shallow for so much water fun. There are beautiful rocks and tide pools, too.

There are resorts tucked into the trees, restaurants and a couple golf courses. We walked a couple miles and never encountered a private beach.

in fact, the whole time we've been in Puerto Vallarta area we've never seen "private beach" or "no dogs allowed" signs, which makes for easy beach bumming.
