# Step 1: Find a company or friend with a fast internet connection.

# Step 2: Install a tower or towers on each end to get line-of-site.

# Step 3: Install 2 directional antennas on the tower and point them at eachother.

# Step 4: Set up a WiFi Access Point



El Tereno is in a broadband desert.  The neighbors have DSL, but it's so slow it might as well be dialup.  We found a wireless ISP in the area, but we were too far from their tower to get service.   Fortunatly our uncle's lab is just over 1 km away and the top of the building can be seen when standing on the wall at the top of El Tereno.  This means we have the important "Line-of-site" for making a high-speed wireless connection.



I chose the Ubiquiti LiteBeam AC because of it's directional antenna design,  good value, and positive experiance with the brand in the past.   There are 2 of these devices pointed at each other.  One is set up on a pole on the top of El Terreno, the other is  pointing out the window of the lab.

The LiteBeam in the lab connects to the internet though the ethernet connection, so it's set up as the "Access point".  The LightBeam in El Terreno is set up as the "Station".
