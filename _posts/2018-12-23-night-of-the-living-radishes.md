We've grown a lovely variety of radishes en El Terreno, but we just eat them. In Oaxaca radishes reach the grandest heights.

We haven't gone (yet - maybe some other year) so this photo is from Gastropod, and you should listen to their [podcast about the annual event](https://gastropod.com/night-living-radishes/).

The tradition comes from a portable nighttime meal, and now it's a [major festival.](https://www.oaxaca-mio.com/fiestas/rabanos.htm)

The most impressive thing our radishes do is self-harvest.
