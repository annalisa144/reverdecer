I've been moving trees. Trees that are failing to thrive, and a few that look alright but they're living in ground that will soon be covered in concrete.
There are plenty of reasons trees might fail to thrive here: long dry season, masses of clay, thick limestone/caliche (we dug through two solid feet of it then couldn't get any deeper with our tools), unfriendly pH, etc.
Many of the trees I've dug up are root bound - their roots are growing in tight circles rather than out. Usually this happens when a tree is in a container too long, and its roots are bound by it. But it also happens when a tree is planted with a parcel of soil into an unfriendly location, and the roots just grow around and around within that bit of soil that it came with.
We'll be watching this dozen-ish trees (along with the rest on the land) and some may need to move again, or at least move into larger holes that have a larger amended environment. I've added aged cow manure, but haven't done anything to change pH, e.g.
What a natural response, to keep growing and growing in ways and places that are comfortable.

This land was farmed for corn, year after year. Unhealthy in any climate or region, this took a toll on this terreno, contributing to erosion and general low vitality. Some plots in our neighborhood have houses, some are empty fields left to succession plants and grazing. Lots of thorn bushes.

When we gaze out of the neighborhood we see trees, and that's what this terreno will be, too, some day.
