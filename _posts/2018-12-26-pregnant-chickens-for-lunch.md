Sounds creepy, sorry for the sleazy headline.

Actually, I had no idea how sleazy *pollo *or* gallina embarazada* was until I typed it into a search engine to prepare this blog post. Don't try it - I'm glad I have a childproof setting on my browser!

Okay, are you intrigued yet?

*Asada* or *asado* is grilled or roasted. There's a style of roasted chicken (has something to do with Aztecs?) that becomes a wordplay of gallina embarazada, not because it's a pregnant chicken (though I guess any chicken living with a rooster is perpetually pregnant).
