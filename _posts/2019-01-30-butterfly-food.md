Not only do the caterpillars depend on milkweed as their sole food source, adult monarchs enjoy milkweed nectar. There is no boring variety of milkweed - how many can you find in your region?

In our countryside milkweed grows wild. But if you live somewhere without plenty of butterfly food, consider these [top-12 varities to plant.](https://blog.nwf.org/2015/02/twelve-native-milkweeds-for-monarchs/)

We've got winter-looking milkweed (pineneedle milkweed)

all at once these days! Plus a few other that I haven't identified.

Any monarchs passing through will enjoy them.

If only nursing moms could survive on weeds - we see so many skeletal dogs in Mexico--apparently this is a puppy season, cause now many of them are nursing. We share food every chance we get, but that's only a taste of relief.

We celebrate with our neighbors that [Tostada and Guayaba](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/04/saying-goodbye-to-booker/) are now sterilized - no new puppies in this stretch of Monico Arias!
