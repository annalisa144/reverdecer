Grasshoppers, *chochos* are turning all leaves into lace. (Did you ever notice that *tatting* becomes *eating* by trading a letter?)

I search for [eggs, worms and insects](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/22/gallery-of-pests-and-predators/) throughout the gardens every couple days, but can't keep up. I'm grateful to the predators, the beneficial bugs and other garden helpers, whose appetites favor squash beetles to squash blossoms.

I think these are the helpful bugs - do you know?

We have a ton of these on our mallow, and they might be lightning bug, margined leatherwing beetle, assasin bug, milkweed bug...any thoughts?

These are the only two frogs I've seen en El Terreno, but they're great predators.

What are these?

Happy to see ladybugs. And that green bug might be good?

Do the bugs think aliens have landed in the garden? The jugs and bottles help with the pests, a little. I scoured websites to identify this moth/butterfly, but never found a match.

Recognize these bugs? They wash off the roof in heavy rain onto our barrel. And this caterpillar...will it become a pest or a predator?

The large predators en El Terreno are my favorite.

We share the grasshopper bounty with the chickens, but soon might try eating them ourselves. With lime, chili and salt.

We have so many lizards and spiders helping out with the bad bugs, they'll each get blog posts of their own. Stay tuned.
