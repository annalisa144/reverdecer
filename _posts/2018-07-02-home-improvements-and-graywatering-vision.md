Why all this reusing water? El Terreno is dry 2/3 of the year or more; the rain comes in the summer. We're trying to stretch that rainwater as far as we can because it's cleaner than the water we can have delivered, it's free, it's what this place is designed to drink, and it's part of [permaculture design](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/06/20/what-is-permaculture/) to put resources to multiple uses.
