message: "Yes, an extension cord adds resistance. That's why I bought the thickest, and most expensive, cord at the store. It adds about one-half-of-one percent to the power use, so moving the freezer out of the van is over all a power savings.\r\n\r\nThe biggest stress for me is the inverter will keep running down the batteries past the point of where they will be broken.  If we use it at night I have to keep checking the batteries to shut it down when the batteries get low.  With the new inverter I plan to make a little circuit that will shut the inverter down automatically when the batteries are low, and I can fall asleep watching Netflix without worries!"
