Isn't it a gift to return to "normal" life and be grateful for small blessings?

For me, it's a bed that we all fit in, and that Max generally can get in and out of without help.

[With Fly gone](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/01/27/el-terreno-incomplete/), half of us moved back to El Terreno to keep Gris company. Certainly cats are more independent than dogs, but an 8-month-old kitty is not happy living alone on this 1.5 acre.

We [keep watching and listening for that stealthy minx](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/01/26/dry-season-foliage/), but each day that goes by seems to seal Fly's fate.

Oh the sacrifices we make for our beloved dependants! I miss Phillip, but we've both been tense and mopey, worrying about the kitties. Good to help Gris hold down the fort.
