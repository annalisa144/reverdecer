The swale is working! Look at that water, slowed, sunk and supporting a green belt across El Terreno. One big rain wet that swale (facing west above) and it hasn't gone dry. Probably won't until November?

We (Phillip) dug [this swale](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/03/swales/) because we're living on a semi-arid hillside and swales are an excellent longterm contribution to health in this context.

Swales (or similar landshaping) might be helpful where you live, too. Do you see any erosion on your landscape? Does water rush through when it rains? [Check out some simple solutions.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/06/level-ground/)
