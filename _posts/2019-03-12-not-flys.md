While we were house/dog-sitting for Stan & Edith earlier this year, [Fly](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/23/fly/) disappeared and [we thought she might have stown-away to their neighborhood](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/01/30/a-cats-life-in-el-terreno/). We increased our reputation trying to figure out if any of the Fly-look-alikes were Fly, spending hours walking the streets with cat food, kneeling next to cars (cats spend a lot of time hiding under parked cars). We subjected Gris to something ... well ... if he *does* steal our souls while we sleep, this could be his justification. Just [read the other post.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/01/30/a-cats-life-in-el-terreno/)

There are dozens of stray cats in that neighborhood alone, and I was troubled by how quickly I cared about the (two? three?) individuals who might-be-Fly. I'd always worried about the local strays - cars, Puki, poisoned food are common dangers. But I'd never taken one home, or sat next to parked cars tossing kibble at one.

We thought about taking in a stray when [we realized mice and rats were living in the van with us,](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/06/23/ven-gatita-y-gatita/) but we thought kittens could bond with our dogs, while older cats might not.

Suddenly, two (or three) of these strays *mattered* more than they did before, because we have claimed responsibility for Fly, and if any of them *were* Fly, we needed to do everything possible to protect and nurture that cat.

And while I feel guilty that I never care so much about the other strays, I realize [it's not possible for my human heart to love everything/everyone all at once.](http://www.annalisagross.com/home/members-of-one-another3808915)

<br>We found another not-Fly in Guanajuato - we know Fly didn't stow-away on this trip, cause this kitty is really skinny. Obviously we should adopt her, right? Especially since she followed us!
