We hoped to return to Capula for more pottery before returning to the US, but we've run out of time. We'll cherish what we've got, and hope not to break any more! Only two pieces lost so far.

Wish we'd brought this back - with the [mole](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/03/13/well-miss-the-mole/)!

Capula is famous for [Catrina dolls](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/11/01/day-of-the-dead/), not just dishes. We skipped those - [a political statement turned exotic-Barbie](https://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/capula-pueblo-donde-nacio-la-catrina-barro.html), and I'm not impressed.
