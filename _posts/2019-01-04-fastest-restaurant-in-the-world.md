We ate at [Karne Garibaldi](http://www.karnegaribaldi.com.mx/), a restaurant in Guadalajara which holds the Guinness Record for the fastest customer service in the world. It was quick service, with expert camareros weaving through the packed dining room.

The food is delicious, too! I like the *botana* (appetizer) *frijoles con elote y totopos.* The main event is *carne en su jugo* which must include beef (*carne*) "in its juice." I noticed crispy pieces of bacon (*tocino*) and what must have been *chorizo*, a multi-animal stew.

Perhaps most record-worthy was the valet staff, cramming (without incident) cars and even our big van into an L-shaped parking lot. But they didn't know how to turn the van on, so Phillip had to get the van back out - I didn't give him a *propina* but was absolutely impressed!
