message: "Thanks Yvonne - that's new advice, to dig such a tight hole. We'll definitely look into it!\r\nThese trees have been watered about 2/month during the dry season (about 3/4 of the year) at least in theory. All of them - the young and the \"old.\" As in, all that Stan planted, not the two that were here before and are 20+ years old. They're doing alright on their own!"
