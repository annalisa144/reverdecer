Going to Los Azufres is like going home to central PA. The only thing missing is all our Stone Church friends!

Though I never saw geothermal power plants in Pennsylvania. Thanks to an inactive volcano there are [geysers to harvest](http://www.annalisagross.com/home/geothermal) and hot springs to enjoy.

With dogs, we prefer to simply stroll and share air with the trees.

I will always thank mountains for breaking the rules as we travel through clouds, like when [we hike up our hillsides on the right sort of misty, moody day.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/10/12/what-planet-is-this/)

Advent turns us to this passage from Luke:
     As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying: “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord;  make His paths straight. Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways shall be made smooth; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.’ ”
																																																																															--Luke 3:4-6
																																																																															
Any day we leave El Terreno on wheels [I wish the rough ways be made smooth](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/02/la-colina-de-la-muerte/). It's a [minor physical assault each trip.](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/11/time-for-that-bottle-of-wine/) Yet each time we leave El Terreno [on foot I delight](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/10/flowers-of-mexico/) at the valleys, mountains, hills, and all crookedness.

This Advent season may I take responsibility for my travels and rejoice in the complex creation we're passing through.
