Before we bade farewell to our friends in Atlanta, we made a last big batch of granola in their fabulous kitchen.

I assumed that without an oven, we'd be without granola. And that's okay - we just eat more [pancakes.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/09/how-to-make-squash-pancakes/)

But of course we can make granola on the stove! The main objective is drying the ingredients out to increase their shelf-life.

With a big road trip coming (yay Cailtin and Nathan!) it's time to try granola on the grill.

We finished it in the solar dehydrator.
