  I remember when I visited Stan 15 years ago at the end of Feb., beginning of March, there was a huge demonstration in the city about something. It seemed a much more normal thing there than it is here. Maybe it happens here more than I realize it, and maybe it's happening more now than it was 15 years ago. In any case, power to the people!
