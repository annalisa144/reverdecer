When we moved to El Terreno, the only structure was a 10,000 liter water tank. Four or five times a year a truck filled it (with dirty water).  Now we have two other structures that have roofs--which means gutters!

We collect from the roofs into a 1,100 liter tank.  During the rainy season we watched the small tank overflow nearly every rain.

But the big tank was still 1/2 full of dirty water, so we wasted a couple weeks trying to decide if we should empty that and start over. Finally we decided to pump half of the water from the small tank to the large tank every time the small tank is full.  When the dry season starts we'll start with a full 10,000  of water, half from the sky. We'll be sure to empty that big tank before the rains start next year so we can have 11,100 liters of clean rainwater.
