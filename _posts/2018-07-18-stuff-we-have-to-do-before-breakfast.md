title: Stuff we have to do before breakfast
---

* wake up before dawn to Max puking (must've gotten into some cat food yesterday and he's allergic to chicken)
* squeeze between all the dogs and cats to get Max out the door before he throws up on the bed
* wipe some puke off the bed
* try to sleep a little more, listening to the most boring podcast in my queue
* another round of Max puking, this time Hannah wants to go out and pee
* wait for Hannah to come back from roaming so we can close the van door
* give up on Hannah and decide to try to sleep with the door open - there are already mosquitos and flies inside, so does it matter?
* give in to the morning and get out of bed
* carry Booker out since he's leaking a little pee
* brush our teeth
* find a toothbrush charger and finish brushing teeth
* get filtered water for nasal irrigation
* all that other hygeine stuff, refill tippy-tap jug to finish washing hands
* refill cat food, dog food, chicken food, and a few water dishes
* change the ice packs in the cooler, which means taking half of the stuff out of the cooler and a few things out of the freezer
* turn on the van cause we don't have enough sun to run the freezer off the solar panels
* wash a few plates cause we had the neighbors over for dinner last night, used all six of our plates, and since they left well after dark we didn't both to wash up last night
* refill a water bucket from rain tank to finish washing those dishes
* heat water in a pot to make coffee in a pour-over
* start cracking eggs onto the griddle - oh crap, one is rotten
* finish cooking the eggs then feed them to all the cats and dogs
* give Booker his medicine
* pick some kale to add more nutrients to the pancakes
* crack eggs into a dish carefully before using in pancake batter
* keep pouring-over that coffee
* offer Phillip a snack - he's starting to look woozy
*
