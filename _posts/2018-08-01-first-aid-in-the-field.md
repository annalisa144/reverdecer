I have a splinter in the arch of my foot. At first I thought I'd pulled a tendon or something, then realized it was the tiniest tip of a thorn, too deep and short to dig out.

Better soak my foot. Of course, we don't have a bathtub.

Which bucket should I use?

| *laundry buckets: wash or rinse* | *sink buckets: hands and dishes* | *garden buckets: mulch and compost* |
