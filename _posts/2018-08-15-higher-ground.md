We got fresh perspective by hiking up to the highest point we could find and looking down on our hillside. By then we could see most of Morelia. Definitely need to use a better camera than my phone - you should be able to see the cathedral and more.<br>

There are higher points to reach and since we have great [freedom to roam here](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/22/the-right-to-roam/), we'll keep exploring. This hike was simply walking on our road until it became a cowpath, taking that cowpath and going up and up until we got to here (photo taken from El Terreno):

We weren't that far from home, but it's nearly impossible to see El Terreno. Click and zoom to try - see my notes?
