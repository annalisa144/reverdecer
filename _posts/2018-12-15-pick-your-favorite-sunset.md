We got a drone, since vanlife doesn't look cool without shots of the van at the beach/cliffside/glade. Turns out we're getting more use out of it for understanding this hillside better and planning the next swales!

It's also handy for capturing sunsets without so much human-structure interference. See the difference between me standing on the ground holding my phone

and Phillip flying the drone above the wall. (Does it go without saying that he was also standing on the ground?)

Drone downside is we don't have filters/lenses to help with light balancing. But maybe someday?
