Just as we head for the border, I've finally lost my Mexico body.

The cracks in my fingers (from gardening, doing laundry by hand, living out in the elements) are nearly healed! I've been using lotion and gloves at night and my skin no longer snags on yarn while I knit.

Sitting around eating with family for a month put a few pounds back on me.

But my big triumph....my feet are clean! Really, truly, clean! I can't tell you how many times I've washed my feet and cleaned under my toenails in Mexico. But living in a van in the rainy season, wearing sandals every day, all that hiking and working...I never, ever, got my feet clean. And the first couple weeks we were in the US I kept washing them. But now that it's time to go back, I realize even my toenails are clean!
