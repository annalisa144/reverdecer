Now that the landscape is bleak, the ground is dusty, the plants are bare, the few flowers are even sweeter. A few that we haven't seen before, and some that look like thirsty versions of wildflowers we've been enjoying.

These might be faboideae? Rosary pea? Any ideas?

The prickly pears bloom throughout the year, though [I'm no longer tempted to harvest them.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/11/prickly-pears/)

These are funky flowers, periptera punicea, a member of the [mallow family](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/29/chocolate-mallow-ice-cream/) - anyone know if they're edible? The grasshoppers are still enjoying them.

Finally, loquat, which I bet is useful for something.
