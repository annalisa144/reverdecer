The rainy season continues. Thank goodness for bike [chain cleaner](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TAJIVG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=annalisa144-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B007TAJIVG&linkId=e75d2f9123b8dd70c9b8c7a85a298fe0).

Actually we're not taking very good care of our bikes - [we didn't expect to have them this long!](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/12/first-theft/)

We left our road/hybrid bikes in the US and got some mountain bikes out of a dumpster. Phillip spent a few hours and about $20 on them. We needed new wheels so went to a bike junkyard/co-op in Atlanta for parts. We quickly realized we should buy some $25 bikes from that shop and save a lot of time.

I can't imagine biking here on a road bike - I walk this mountain bike frequently, especially in the rainy season.

Phillip taught me a cool trick; when we have to cross a stream he throws his bike across in front of him and leaps behind it (holding on to the frame the whole time). I practiced on flat ground and haven't tried it over water yet.

I won't miss the potholes or *topes* but I'm glad to know what these [bikes of burden](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/23/beasts-and-bikes-of-burden/) can handle.
