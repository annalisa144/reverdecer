Virtually every time we go into Morelia we have to take the scariest hill, whether by bike or car/truck. We could go another way on bike, adding 30 min each way. By truck we could only avoid it by going off-road altogether, and perhaps get stuck.

But if we ever get stuck, if the transmission goes out (which is does), if a tire blows, on **the scariest hill** I think we're done for. It's a steep hill+sharp curve+cliffside+narrow road+potholes.

The other day someone had filled in some potholes and left behind dog food bags filled with rocks to protect the roadwork. So we got an obstacle course, too.

Our [Christmas vacation to Puerto Vallarta](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/29/my-kind-of-puerto-vallarta/) showed us how much better Jalisco roads are. [Michoacan can't afford to pay teachers](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/01/28/demonstration-season/) or fix roads?

I want to communicate the terror through video, but this is the best I can do. (Hill starts around :41)
