Electricty is stored in the batteries at a nominal 12 volts DC, so we use 12 volts with as few conversions as possible.

Some things we power directly at 12 volts from two "cigarette lighter" plugs: The vent fan, the other fan, AA battery charger, [water pump](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/18/saving-for-a-not-rainy-day/), [laptop car charger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005I56RM2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=annalisa144-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B005I56RM2&linkId=b8843bffdc80849436360a6b9b62eeba).

For things that are USB powered we use a 4 port USB car charger: charging cell phones, charging the bluetooth speaker, powering the humidifier.

We have a 1000 watt pure sine wave inverter for powering 120 volt AC appliances: our freezer, coffee maker, and charging our toothbrushes.

By far our biggest electricity user is the freezer. We tried powering it with a cheap modified sine inverter, but we kept running out of power during the rainy season.  Since we upgraded the inverter the PV panels were able to supply all of our electricty, even on cloudy days.

Since the freezer uses so much power, we only run it during the day. The freezer is well insulated enough that all the contents stay frozen over night.

With 1000 watts inverter we have to check how many watts the applicances use before buying them.  Things that heat or cool are the hardest.  All the coffee makers we found in the US, used more than 1000 watts, but we were able to find a single cup coffee maker in Mexico that only uses 650 watts. It's still puts a strain on our little power plant, so we have to make sure the batteries have enough charge before making a cup. Solar coffee, what a luxury!
