I have ophidiophobia or ophiophobia (fear of snakes). Not herpetophobia (fear of reptiles) since anything with legs is no longer terrifying. [Lizards (snakes with legs), for example, are fascinating to me](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/11/06/lizard-gallery/) especially [when engaging the cats](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/11/09/kittens-vs-lizards/).

But snakes freak me out so much that I have to stick a camera between us to keep from turning to flee. Why was this snake in a decorative pool near the San Antonio River?

While we discussed it, a kinder passerby moved it out with a stick.

You know how when you see a stick lying just so on the ground, you jump back or gasp before realizing it's NOT a snake, it's just a stick?

Our amygdala processes this potential threat with a hormones to boost our reactivity. Then our visual processing decides whether it's a snake or stick.

Turns out, same with our ears!

We were hiking when Phillip, several strides ahead, pointed back to my feet and said, "There's a snake skin!" And as I gasped and jumped back I processed the "skin" part.

The skin might be interesting, except it means a snake was there, in a place we often hike. We've seen a dead one on the road and only one, alive, in El Terreno. But even though I don't want to interact with snakes, I want El Terreno to be a place that attracts them - as in, a place full of life.

[At least they're safer than the scorpions.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/06/26/picadura-escorpion/)
