11. Cool, then sprinkle pecans over brownies and drizzle remaining caramel, then cut.

**Caramel**

* 1 can (13-14 oz) full-fat coconut milk OR 1/2 c milk/half-and-half + 3 T butter
* ½ cup honey, maple syrup or sugar
* Pinch of salt

* 1 T olive oil, coconut oil or butter
* 2 t vanilla

**Directions**

In a medium saucepan with a thick bottom combine first three ingredients.

Bring to boil over medium-high heat. Lower the heat to medium-low and let reduce for about 35 minutes, stirring every now and then.

Add remaining ingredients and cook for further 5 minutes.

It may take more or less time depending on your stove and pot. Stir and scrape the bottom. Some burning will be tasty, but not much. Most importantly, don't let anything stick to the bottom for long.
Remove from the heat and cool for at least 5 minutes, then stir until smooth and glossy.
