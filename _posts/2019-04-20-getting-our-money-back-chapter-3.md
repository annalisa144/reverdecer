We've spent a lot of time and money trying to get ~$1000 back from the Mexican government. We paid a lot for temporary resident visas for our time in Mexico, and turns out [we paid too much](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/03/18/getting-our-money-back/).

[We probably won't get the extra $1000 back, but we're still trying](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/05/09/getting-our-money-back-chapter-2/) and the saga continues into at least a fourth chapter!
