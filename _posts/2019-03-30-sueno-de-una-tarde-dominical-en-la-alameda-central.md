Diego Rivera's mural *Sueño de una Tarde Dominical en la Alameda Central* has its own house, *Museo Mural Diego Rivera*. If the picture of the park was out in the park, with sun, rain, wind and people, it wouldn't last long. Though it's survived an earthquake!

Thanks to the earthquake, "Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the Alameda Central" is in the Alameda Central. Rivera painted it at/in/for *Hotel del Prado* near the park, but the 1985 earthquake damaged the hotel so much that the mural had to move to survive.

We stepped inside a bunch of museums in [Mexico City](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/03/28/mexico-city-just-a-taste/), but this is the one place we bought tickets. (If we'd had more time, we would've paid the price at *Palacio de Bellas Artes*, too!) In addition to ogling the 150+ people gracing 45+ feet of wall, we poured over photos of the earthquake's damage and the process of moving the mural.

Next we'll need to read a dozen history texts to understand the people, movements and eras that Rivera painted in the park. Anyone know what the kid-Diego has in his pocket? (You can zoom in on our photos to check, but it will be blurry.)
