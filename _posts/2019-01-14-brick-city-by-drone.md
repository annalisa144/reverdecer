title: Brick city by drone

After we moved to El Terreno in April, a brick-building city war born on the neighboring hillside. It's expanding. You can [read more about it and see closer-up photos here.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/03/brick-city/)

But now we have some drone footage, too.

What will it look like when they're done making bricks? The tarps will go, the trucks that still run will roll away - maybe we'll come back in a few years and find out.
