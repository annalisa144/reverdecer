We have one tiny mirror, so unless I catch my reflection at the right time of day in the van window, I never see anything below my neck. Not a problem, though it could be nice to know how weird my sandals look with a skirt.

Now I don't even see my face, since the mirror is dirty and I never get around to cleaning it.

I remember when, wearing contacts, looking in the mirror each morning and night was essential. Once I got my eyes upgraded, I might go a day or two without looking in a mirror, but rarely - think about how virtually all public or private bathrooms have large mirrors. Not our outhouse. We have other things to look at!
