Simple cookie to dress up after baking:

• 1 c butter/coconut oil, room temperature (aka softened, if you're making in a cold space)

• 1/2 c sugar

• 1 egg

• 1 t vanilla 

• 1/2 t salt (to taste, esp if you're using salted butter)

• 2 c ww flour (use ground nuts, pastry flour, or whatever you prefer)
	
Use as filling for sandwich of two cookies, or dip 1/2 of each cookie into, or just slather on each cookie any or all of the following:

• 1/2 c peanut butter combined with honey

• 1/2 c jam

• 1/2 c chocolate chips or chopped chocolate bar, melted in double boiler or in microwave at 20 sec bursts (pick bittersweet, semisweet, dark, milk, etc. based on your own preference)

• once you've got something sticky on the cookies, you can add sprinkles, finely chopped nuts, or shredded dried coconut
	
Blend butter and sugar well. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until combined. Combine salt and flour, then add to wet ingredients.
I've read that you can cut the corner off a plastic bag and pipe these cookies - when I tried it, the hole got bigger with each cookie. Perhaps mine were too dry, or I was impatient? Regardless, I switched to rolling - you can do it by hand and then press, or use a rolling pin. These cookies are convenient for dipping or sandwiches if they are 2" by 3/4" rectangles. Or roll and cut into fun shapes.

Bake at 350 degrees for about 11 minutes (until edges are golden). Parchment paper helps.

Let cool completely. If you don't need to reuse your cookie sheets, you can cool on the sheet (but don't leave them on top of the stove - too warm there).

Decorate and eat.
