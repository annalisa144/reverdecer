Sounds creepy, sorry for the sleazy headline.

Actually, I had no idea how sleazy *pollo embarazada* was until I typed it into a search engine to prepare this blog post. Don't try it - I'm glad I have a childproof setting on my browser!

Okay, are you intrigued yet?

*Asada* or *asado* is grilled or roasted. *Vara* is stick. There's a style of roasted chicken that becomes a wordplay of gallina embarazada, not because it's a pregnant chicken (though I guess any chicken living with a rooster is perpetually pregnant). 

Put the chicken on a stick and roast it over fire. *Pollo en vara asado* or if you say it fast enough, it becomes *pollo embarazada.* It's a Michoacan speciality, and a Michoacan joke. Let me know if you've heard it anywhere else?

And by the way, it's delicious. I don't usually enjoy meat, but fresh off the fire I'll eat seconds of this. [Here's a recipe](https://cookpad.com/co/recetas/975674-pollo-asado-sabor-estilo-patzcuaro) if you want to try it, though you might as well just come visit us and let someone else do the work! They're seriously efficient.
