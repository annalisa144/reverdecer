[My first attempt at botanical dyeing was a flop,](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/02/20/dyeing-with-avocado/) though fun.

*avocado*

This wool yarn is holding the color, but probably only because I haven't rinsed it! Since I avoid washing wool items, a finished project from this yarn might please me, but most people eventually do wash (even wool). Guess I better take a deep breath and rinse. Any predictions?

I'd read that I wouldn't need a mordant with avocado, and hoped that the internet was right about that, since I didn't want to mess around with potentially poisonous metal. As so often happens, saving time in the short time means spending even more total time on a project, since I'll have to do it at least twice!
