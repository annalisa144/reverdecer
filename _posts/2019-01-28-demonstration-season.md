We've heard that March is demonstration season in Mexico (the pun doesn't work in Spanish, since *marzo* and *marchar* aren't the same word).

But plenty of demonstrations are happening right now - the other night we found two in a row. Teachers and their supporters shut down the trains in this city.

Back in Morelia, educators and others were demonstrating in the city centre. You hear the same [cynical criticism about striking teachers in Mexico](http://www.lavozdemichoacan.com.mx/morelia/610379/) as in the US.

I still don't understand [this story](http://www.lavozdemichoacan.com.mx/regional/padres-de-familia-son-encadenan-por-oponerse-a-cierre-de-una-escuela/) - I assumed the parents chained themselves to the school to protest its closure - but I guess others in the town chained them up?!
