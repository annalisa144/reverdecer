We've heard that March is demonstration season in Mexico (the pun doesn't work in Spanish, since *marzo* and *marchar* aren't the same word).

But plenty of demonstrations are happening right now - the other night we found two in a row. Teachers and their supporters shut down the trains in this city.

[Trains are shut down like this throughout the state of Michoacan](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/teachers-refuse-to-end-michoacan-rail-blockade/) by teachers and supporters, demanding back pay. Apparently neither the federal nor state governments have enough money. The train blockades are contributing (at least a little) to the [gas shortage,](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/01/21/getting-gas/) since some fuel could be moved by train.

And the gas shortage is a response to fuel theft, which is [one reason the government doesn't have enough money](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/petroleum-theft-cost-pemex-147-billion/) to pay teachers.

Both the gas shortage and the underfunded schools are complex issues, but drug cartels/organized crime have a huge responsibility in both scenes. They intimidate government officials into corruption (bribe the easy ones, threaten to murden the tough ones) and over time, the government doesn't serve the average Mexican citizen, it serves the elite (sound familiar?). AMLO really seems to be resisting, but that doesn't fully fund the education system overnight.

Educators and others are demonstrating in Morelia's city centre, too. You hear the same [cynical criticism about striking teachers in Mexico](http://www.lavozdemichoacan.com.mx/morelia/610379/) as in the US.

I still don't understand [this story](http://www.lavozdemichoacan.com.mx/regional/padres-de-familia-son-encadenan-por-oponerse-a-cierre-de-una-escuela/) - when I first saw the photo, I assumed the parents chained themselves to the school to protest its closure - but [officials chained them up!](https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/estados/encadenan-papas-por-defender-escuela-bilingue-en-comunidad-indigena) Lord have mercy.
