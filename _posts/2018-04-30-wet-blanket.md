Follow-up on laundry...our bedding is too big for bucket washing, so I've been hanging sheets and blankets out and spot cleaning. Which is a good use of time and water, it turns out, which I never would have chosen if we had a normal electric washing machine. My perspective on clean and cleaning is rather circumstantial, it turns out. More on that another time.
I shook and hung out all our bedding today and looked forward to a clean bed tonight. We went out to use the internet and do errands and it took forever - turns out everyone is shopping today to celebrate tomorrow's holiday (May 1 is the holiday here).
While we were out it rained, which was not in the forecast, and we fantasized that it wasn't raining on our mountainside. But we came home to wet blankets at dusk, and the best way to dry them is to touch them, so we're in bed with wet blankets. We gave Max the single dry blanket and Hannah and Booker have towels between them and wet blankets - they're so tender! We did have dry, clean sheets.
I wanted to turn on the van for a little heat, but we're low on gas. The pick-up, which we're using for errands, had trouble on the way up the hill tonight. So tomorrow we'll stay home and I'll dig all day looking for places without feet of limestone, and Phillip will build a chicken tractor. And if it doesn't rain too much I'll be making something with chocolate - we need to cheer up!
