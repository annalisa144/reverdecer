Baking in [our grill](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/08/our-grill/) is disappointing. But we love dessert so we keep trying.

We've made cakes, brownies, [crisps](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/27/how-to-make-apple-crisp-in-a-grill/) and more. 

Baking isn't that different from roasting, which people often do in grills. But those are big grills and big cuts of meat. We have a trim and portable grill, which means baking is nearly impossible. Baking requires indirect heat, and our grill is so tight that it's hard to space without direct heat.

[Pizza](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/10/pizza-on-the-grill/) works fabulously, but that's grilling, not baking.

We've only [sacrificed one dish](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/17/our-favorite-mistakes/) in this learning process.

The {skillet cookie](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/12/skillet-cookie/) is a good work-around, but I think skillet brownies would be dry and disappointing.

We can get a dessert fix without baking via [avocado chocolate "mousse"](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/04/chocolate-avocado-mousse/) or [mallow ice cream](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/29/chocolate-mallow-ice-cream/) and while both are delicious, they aren't hot, gooey brownies. At least [hot chocolate](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/02/how-to-make-chocolate/) is hot!
