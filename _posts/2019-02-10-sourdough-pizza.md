Since the best part of a pizza is the toppings, we don't care much about the dough! I mean, we [roll it thin and grill it](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/10/pizza-on-the-grill/), which yields an excellent texture, so we've never tweaked that part.

But now we're keeping a [sourdough starter](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/02/06/sourdoughs/) lively, so why not try it in pizza dough? Turns out sourdough pizza dough has extra (enjoyable!) flavor.

We're still using some storebought yeast, too, though maybe as our sourdough matures we could stop - anyone have experience with that?

Our previous pizza dough recipe made about 8 batches at once, which is convenient since they freeze well. But now we're doing one big pizza at a time, something like this:

* 1 cup sourdough starter, unfed/discard
* 1/2 cup warm water
* scant 2 cups whole wheat flour (*integral* in Mexico)
* scant 1 cup corn meal, or ground nuts, oats, etc
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast
* add herbs and parmesan if you like

Mix all ingredients, adding water/flour as needed for kneadable dough. Knead about 5 minutes, then leave to rise in a warm place. This could be on top of your fridge, if you have one. Or in the sun. Or in an oven that has a pilot light (but take it out before you preheat the oven!).

The dough should double in size as it rises, so hopefully you have it in a big bowl or container. Put a towel over it to keep dust and bugs out. Rising might take 2-4 hours, depending on many factors - including how warm it is. If you need pizza dough sooner, definitely find a warm spot, and/or double the yeast.

Check out that dough - does it fit the pizza stone, jelly roll pan, grill, or whatever you're planning to bake in? You can divide as needed, roll thinner or thicker as you desire. Go for it.

Let the dough rest in this shape (covered with a towel or something) for at least 15 minutes. Or perhaps all afternoon, if your sourdough is tired or you want it to rise thicker.

Bake around 450F, to your taste. If you've got a thicker crust you might benefit from baking it naked for a few minutes before adding toppings.
