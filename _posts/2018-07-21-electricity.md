We don't have electricity here. That is, we're not on the grid. We do have solar panels on the roof of the van and they're enough to charge our laptops, phones and toothbrushes. But not enough to run our freezer, it turns out. Phillip picked out this freezer especially to work with our solar panels and inverter, so we're disappointed. It's using as much as three times the energy it was supposed to. In part because we have a problem in the inverter? In part because we're changing out ice packs a couple times a day to use our cooler as an ice pack?

We turn everything off at night (you know, no sun, no power). But now that we're in the cloudy rainy season we don't have enough solar power until afternoon to turn the freezer on. Since we depend on the freezer for ice packs for our cooler (ice box) and have food stored in the freezer too, we've been running the van at least once a day this rainy season.

We're not driving the van (it's holding up a shade cloth and we just don't want to take it out on the rough road until absolutely necessary) so when we run out of gas in the van we bring it in a can. Neighbors' trash ends up in este terreno a menudo and recently we found a funnel - thanks, neighbors:-)

Phillip is researching options: new panel, different inverter - even a different freezer? Probably the first two soon and leave this freezer in Mexico (it takes up so much space and when we have to cram all our belongings back in here...) and get a new one in the US eventually. We did take the freezer out of the van so it gets better airflow, and Phillip has a plan to wrap pipe around its hot motor to heat water and cool the freezer.

Occasionally we use solar power to grind coffee beans, heat water, humidify the van or use our immersion blender making *chocolate*. We have internet now that mostly works (Phillip will have to explain all that) and the router and antenna are easy to solar power even on a cloudy day.

Phillip was careful to research what we could plug in and use with this set-up and other than the freezer it's all worked out. It is annoying that we can only use electricity in the van, so occasionally cooking takes place both crouched in the van and also in the outdoor kitchen (e.g., grinding coffee).

Oh, two more appliances - first the ceiling vent fan that keeps us cool on hot days. Last the little fan Phillip got out of an old computer that helps dry out our toilet. That's on an extension cord - the toilet is as far from the van as possible!

The only things I miss are our food processor and instant pot. Eventually we'll build an adobe oven and that will make it possible to bake *well* again. We do keep baking:-) And someday a solar oven will allow us to cook dry beans. For now we're buying canned.

We might end up with electricity through the power lines - they're already there (see photo above) and our uncle has to pay a rural electric fee each month just cause the lines are there.

But an official electrician will need to come out and install it onto this property according to specific specifications, and we're not interested in taking that on. We'd rather keep learning how to live off-grid. But seriously, if someone brings power onto this property we'll have the freezer out of the van in about 4 minutes and breathe easier (less van fumes, too).
