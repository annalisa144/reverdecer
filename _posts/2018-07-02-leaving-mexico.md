Mexico elected a new president yesterday, along with about 18,000 other officials. What I hear and read in the [news about AMLO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Manuel_L%C3%B3pez_Obrador) is [promising](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/mexico-election-amlo-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador), but I haven't talked to any Morelianos who are excited about him.

I'm flying to the US today for our chruch's Annual Conference. I worried the election could disrupt my travel, [after all the murders, threats and polls shut down this season.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-44671462)

But what threatened my trip was the World Cup: after a pre-dawn three hour bus ride I still needed to get to the airport, and waited in a long taxi line for an hour. Hard to get anyone to drive.taxis when Mexico is playing Brazil in the World Cup!

Then I finally get to the airline desk and discover I'm at the wrong airport. I'm surprised-Queretaro doesn't seem big enough for two airports. No, the wrong city, the wrong state, two hours further north.
Maybe Caleb at United is a happy Amlo fan, maybe he takes pity on my broken Spanish, maybe he's just a well-trained and helpful person. He changes my flight for free.

How did I make this mistake? I looked many options to make this trip less expensive. Apparently I confused this 12:40 - 14:50 flight to Houston with the 12:40 - 14:50 flight to Houston leaving from Leon. Why United has these identical flights from different cities confuses my sleep-deprived brain, but I know Caleb is good for this country and hope Amlo will be too.
