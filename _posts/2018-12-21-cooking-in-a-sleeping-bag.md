Maybe we have to cook in a sleeping bag cause we're living offgrid and it's December? Can you picture us wrapped up in blankets standing around the [grill](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/08/our-grill/)?

Not a bad idea for breakfast or late dinner, but it's been [hot every fabulous, sunny winter afternoon,](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/12/09/july-in-christmas/) much hotter than summer! (Not the nights, though, we woke up to ice in the water this morning, but at least we don't have to worry about freezing pipes - we have no pipes,)

But we've actually developed a way to cook in a sleeping bag that we recommend - even if you have a fully electric life.

We bring beans/rice/veggies/soup to a boil on the grill, then wrap the pot in our sleeping bag and wait. it stays **hot** for hours, even stays warm overnight. Rice gets overcooked easily - we never pull it out soon enough. Beans require a second boil, or even a third. But this is still a vast improvement over cooking beans on the grill - we always seem to run out of propane before the beans get soft, and hours on the grill is a total waste of gas.

We've tried beans in a thermos, too (see header photo). Bring to boil, then pour into a thermos and wrap that in a sleeping bag. Still takes two rounds of coming to a boil, but better than wasting hours of propane.

[We have tried passive solar cooking](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/10/16/welcome-to-our-kitchen/) but it takes days and the food starts to smell bad before it's cooked. We got a big piece of glass so may try adapting the solar oven, again. Now that the rains are gone we have more hours of sunlight - what a great winter!
