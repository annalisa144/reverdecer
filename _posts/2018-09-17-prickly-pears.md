Resilient, independent, delicious, nutritious, evolving [prickly pears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia). Not just a plant - a role model!

I've suffered for this plant a few times.

There was a small prickly pear cactus in El Terreno when we came, and with a little weeding and mulch it has doubled in size. But one didn't seem sufficient.

I decided to bring home a pad from a particularly hearty, healthy looking cactus to propigate a new one. They're all over roadsides, so it was easy to pick one. I picked the pad as carefully as possible, but couldn't avoid all the thorns.
