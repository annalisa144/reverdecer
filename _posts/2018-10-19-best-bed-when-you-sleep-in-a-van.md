title: Best bed when you sleep in a van with pets

Our bed is as good as it gets for life in the van.

Phillip got the frame online and adapted it to sit above the wheel wells.

He added plywood for comfort.

And best of all, he cut and adapted it so we can have a couch. This is essential to our happiness. Before the couch we'd try to sit in bed (to read, knit, work on our laptops) and could never get comfortable. We couldn't sit up straight because our heads hit the ceiling. A few pillows along the windows could work for awhile, but not for both of us at the same time. The couch is angled just right - as high as possible without our heads hitting - and I have worked on my laptop for entire days comfortably. (Well, my butt falls asleep eventually.)

Our matresses have served us reasonably well, but we'll be replacing them soon. Phillip has patched them about ten times, which is annoying (but glad we can repair rather than throw away!). But now we're at a crossroads, and it's the cats' fault. They instinctively do that claw stretch thing, and have added holes to the top of the mattresses - and the tops can't be patched (too slippery).

We have to re-inflate in the night now, and that's a drag. [We're definitely taking years off our lives.](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/10/26/premature-aging/)

We've had 24 muddy feet going in and out of this bed all rainy season, so we learned to put our matress cover on top of everything (pillows and blankets too) to semi-protect the bed. It also helps with [Booker's](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/06/booker/) incontinence and [Max's](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/05/max/) perpetually poop-stained butt. We've still had to wash the bedding inconveniently often, but the matress cover catches more than half the stains.

It has to be over everything to work, though, and sometimes we forget to finish the job after getting all the animals out, or Hannah gets cold and subterfuges the situation.

Our latest innovation that keeps a little poop off the bed is Max's special blankets. We got a cheap fleece blanket and cut it into 5 pieces, each about a square yard. When Max is getting ready to lay down we drape a little blanket on/around him, and the poop smears are contained. These little blankets are easier to wash (and faster to dry) than our full-size blankets. Plus Max prefers to be completely under a blanket at all times (except when walking or eating) so we have his little blankets in the van and kitchen to tuck him in, and he never gets in between our sheet anymore. Thank God.
