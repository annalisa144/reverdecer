Eating avocado as much as possible, we wondered what we could do with the skins. Dye! [Made a lovely pink color, but it didn't last.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/02/21/dyeing-yarn-with-plants/)

I tried again with a homemade mordant, soaking rusty metal from El Terreno in a water/vinegar solution for ... a week at least? 

Then I soaked t-shirts and more of that 70% cotton 30% polyester drop cloth.

Before washing, they looked dismal.

After washing in cold water without soap (an energetic rinse, really), they look blah. Won't try this again anytime soon!

That's okay, we have enough hobbies. And [we've left avocado country.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/03/19/goodnight-and-good-luck-el-terreno/)
