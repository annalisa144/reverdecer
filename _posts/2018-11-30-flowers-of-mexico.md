I can't wait to flood your feeds with  better pictures of flowers, now that I have a better camera. In the meantime, here are just a few flowers that celebrate Mexico by name:

The rainy season was supposed to be over about a month ago, but now  the waters are trickling out. What will be the next round of blooms? Stay tuned.
