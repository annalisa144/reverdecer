message: "Mosquitoes love me, and I loathe them. I'm not a fan of the stinky bracelets, but I do  use an Off clip-on. It's a battery powered fan device, with replaceable repellant cartridges. \r\n\r\nFor those lucky cats, what about a screen, mosquitoe netting, or scrap fabric \"doorway\" in a window? Cats are so smart, you could teach them to jump right through as a game during the day... Probably would have to position something for them to hop up on to get up there, or maybe a plank of wood as a catwalk?\r\n\r\nSleep deprivation is no joke, and I'm a big believer that sleep is sacred. I know you're \"roughing it\" but whatever you can do to ensure a better night's sleep is worth it! Peace be with you! ‚ù§"
