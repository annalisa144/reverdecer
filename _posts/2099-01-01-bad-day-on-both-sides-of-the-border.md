I expected to be disgusted and dismayed by the Kavanaugh hearings and treatment of Dr. Ford today. [Investigate a powerful, popular man? Not worth it, not even when women risk their lives to speak up.](https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Mexico-Ayotzinapa-Case-Investigating-Army-Not-The-Objective-20180928-0021.html)

Many Mexicans are [trying to hold on to hope for president-elect AMLO,](http://www.resurj.org/post/elected-president-green-wave-and-bittersweet-never-ending-hope-legal-abortion-mexico) but today his administration looked same-old-stale-corruption.

We voted absentee in May - thanks Wabash County for making that easy! We'll be in the US for Nov elections (thanks to Nathan and Caitlin getting hitched) and I wish I could vote for Ana Maria Archila and Maria Gallagher. I'm taking a deep breath amidst despair and frustration to breathe in humanity, courage and vulnerability. [This conversation is so awkward!](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-45684050/republican-senator-flake-cornered-by-sexual-assault-survivor) My skin crawls to watch it. The awkwardness of real life, real people with strong emotion and Jeff Flake's total horror. More *reality* tv, please! Especially because Sen Flake and his staff would never have stood there listening for two minutes without all those cameras.

Prediction: by 2020 there will be greater abortion access in Mexico than the US. Easier to get an abortion on the south side of the border than Texas, we hear. The more these countries change, the more the leaders all look the same. And, happily, the more I look around, the more *we the people* **especially we the women** all look the same!
