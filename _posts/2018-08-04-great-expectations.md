At the turn of the year I was interviewed about our adVanture for a podcast. I listened to it this week and chuckled at some of my grand, dreamy and incorrect assumptions. [Listen to it and tell me what you notice!](http://arlingtoncob.org/49-into-the-van/)

Many of you heard me say these things in person, too, how we'd get started in El Terreno by digging some ponds for water storage, then create swails and other landshaping to **slow, spread and sink rainwater**. [Read about why swails matter.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/03/swails/)

When we got here we realized that the sun is so strong we'd need REALLY deep ponds (at least 9 m) to store water, or it would just evaporate. We've done a lot of digging, but we're not going to do that much. Sure we could contract with an excavator and operator, but that takes Spanish-negotiation-assistance and money. And if we don't want to leave such big holes on this land unless it's going to benefit El Terreno (and my uncle) in the longer term.

During our first couple months here Phillip's time was consumed by construction and shelter projects. I don't know much about landshaping and wasn't going to try swails on my own. So I just started seeds and garden beds, and now we have about eight garden zones with vegetables, herbs and flowers. It's been satisfying work and we're eating great salads and [putting squash in everything](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/17/pancakes/), but we didn't move to Mexico to garden.

We came here to be part of healing in this plot of land. The gardens I've planted are adding more life to the soil, but what the place needs longterm is trees.
