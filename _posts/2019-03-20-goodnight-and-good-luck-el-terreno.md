We waved goodbye to El Terreno, with no idea when we'll see it again. We have more swales to dig, trees to plant, hikes to take, but no concrete plans for return. Among myriad memories, we'll picture sunsets over El Terreno.

We can't see this many city lights standing on the ground, but climb on the shower or wall, or send up a drone, and there's the city! Nearly a million people live in the Morelia metro area. The sun sets on all of us, urban and rural, Mexican and foreign, staying and leaving, the same.
