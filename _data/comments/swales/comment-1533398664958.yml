  You know, it wasn't as bad as we expected! Of course, Phillip's done all the
  work, but in just 2-5 hours a day for less than a week. I'd say cutting the
  weeds has been the worst part for him since his allergies are severe. He's
  been semi-catatonic at times this week. I asked him to teach me to use the
  weed-wacker thing, but then I got some kind of (spider?) bite and swelled up
  and became semi-catatonic myself. (Two night ago) So swale #2 should be more
  collaborative! But we'll give the first one a little time to show its utility
  before we start the next one!
