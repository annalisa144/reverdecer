A couple weeks ago we celebrated [Mexican independence](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/09/15/dia-de-independencia/) at the festival de mezcal.

[Mezcal is in resurrgence](http://localhost:4000/2018/10/03/mezcal/) and some are delightful. But my favorite consumable at the festival was the [escamol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escamol).

Clever, my uncle brought this to our table and suggested we try it before finding out what we were eating. Cheesy, creamy, like rich cottage cheese.

We figured eggs or larva, but couldn't guess what animal. Ants! It was so delicious I considered harvesting en El Terreno, since we have so many ants. But they're too fiery. I'll leave that to the pros.
