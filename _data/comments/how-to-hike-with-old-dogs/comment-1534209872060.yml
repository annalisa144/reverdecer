message: "You know, we've been thinking Booker was on his last leg for so long that we're totally acustomed to spoiling him and thoroughly enjoying him - even his distractions. He's good for work/life balance, or something:-)\r\n\r\nPuki...well, the muzzle has helped a bit - I'm impressed by how quickly he adapted to it. We don't use it much though because he doesn't bother the chicken house anymore. I think because the last time he did, Stan, Edith, Phillip and I were all yelling at him and a couple times we dumped water on him when he was going after the chickens. Pretty cool to watch him learn! He's still a beast to walk though. And we'll never let him meet the kittens!"
