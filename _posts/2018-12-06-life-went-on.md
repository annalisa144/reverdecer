[We spent a month in the US visiting family](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/11/03/sort-of-married/) and life went on in El Terreno (por supuesto!) Specifically, the rainy season (which ends in Sept/Oct) continued through November, and plant life and bug life unexpectedly continued to thrive. Like this enormous grasshopper!

<br>Our gardens are overgrown - grasses, poisonous nightshade, but we have plenty of kales, cilantro, radishes, lettuces and even some tomatoes and carrots to eat.

Along the swales the daikon radishes keep coming. We planted them as *tillage radishes*, to aerate and break up this compacted (clayful) ground. But they're not quite tough enough - sometimes they're *self-harvesting radishes*.

My favorite garden find may be this spider, whose body is over an inch long - it's gorgeous!

Could it, please, be big enough to take down some grasshoppers?
