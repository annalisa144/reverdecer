I wish the kittens would leave [the lizards alone](http://localhost:4000/2018/11/06/lizard-gallery/) - we like lizards! They eat bugs and [bugs are pretty annoying.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/10/cut-out-the-middle-man/)

But the cats can't help themselves when the crevice swifts start their push-up routine.

At least they eat them. Ew. Nature. But no waste!

The lizards have a strong defensive instinct - this chubby one "hid" for hours when we surprised it!

But they can't escape our tigers for long.
