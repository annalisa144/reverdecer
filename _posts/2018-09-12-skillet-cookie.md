We graduated to an all-stevia dessert!

No matter which school-of-diet-thought you turn to, sugar is hard on our bodies. So we've been using a blend of sugar and stevia. Stevia's taste is strong and distracting so this blend is about 1% stevia, 99% sugar. But since stevia is SO strongly sweet, this blend is supposed to be 2x as sweet as "plain" sugar. So if you're making a recipe that calls for 1 cup of sugar, just use 1/2 cup of this blend.

(Well, we do that automatically with any recipe, anyway, start by using just half the sugar recommended. It's enough 95% of the time.)

Since we've been using this blend for a couple months, I figured we were getting accustomed to stevia's harsh taste. So I made oatmeal/pecan/chocolate chip cookies (lots of flavor in there) with stevia as the only sweetener (except the chocolate chips were normal sugar). And it worked! I mean, we can tell they have stevia, but it doesn't detract at all.

I didn't measure, but it was probably something like:
* 4 cups oats
* 1 cup flour (half whole wheat, half white)
* 1 t baking soda
* 1 stick butter
* 2 eggs
* 1 t stevia
* 2 t vanilla
* 1 t cinnamon
* splash of milk
* 1 cup chocolate chips
* 1 cup pecans (thanks Aunt Beth!)

As you may know, we struggle with baking in [our grill](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/08/08/our-grill/). So it's easier to just eat cookie dough than make cookies (and we like cookie dough a smidge better than cookies anyway). But we don't trust grocery store eggs (gallinas are still working on their first eggs) so I had to bake these. Well, time to try a new method: skillet cookie.

It totally worked!

The bottom got brown and crispy while the middle-top was still moist, but we knew the whole thing had been hot enough to eat with confidence.

With all those oats these are more granola bar than cookie, except really sweet - that stevia is strong. I had a chunk for breakfast today and 5 hours later, [waiting at the vet](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/07/09/family-trip/) (one of our main hobbies in Mexico) I still felt full, Never got a sugar rush.

Highly recommend - unless you have a normal oven, then just make bar cookie/granola bars:-)

Anyone else using stevia?
