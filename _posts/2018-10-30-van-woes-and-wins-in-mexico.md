title: Van woes and wins in Mexico
---

So, we got the fuel pump replaced on the van yesterday.
[10/18, 11:37 AM] Phillip: And the oil changed
[10/18, 11:38 AM] Phillip: It was was a bit of a challenge. It was supposed to be done by 6. We arrived at 6:15. They were still finishing up. They had no gas and no oil or filter for the oil change.
[10/18, 11:39 AM] Phillip: They gave us a gas can, and Stan took me to the nearest gas station to fill it.
[10/18, 11:39 AM] Phillip: Then we drove around a little to find an oil place.
[10/18, 11:40 AM] Phillip: First they tried to sell us a tiny filter that I knew wasn't right. Then a bigger one that looked promising.
[10/18, 11:52 AM] Phillip: Then we took everything back to the mechanic. They put the gas in, started it. All was good.
[10/18, 11:52 AM] Phillip: Then they did the oil change. The filter was the same. That all worked.
[10/18, 11:53 AM] Phillip: His labor for everything was 400 pesos (about $20)
[10/18, 11:55 AM] Phillip: It was about 7:30 at this point, so I rush off to the vet to return their cage. They are about 1/4 mile away and are about to close.
[10/18, 11:57 AM] Phillip: When I get there the doors are locked, but they are still cleaning up, so I give them the cage.
[10/18, 11:57 AM] Phillip: The I start to go and the engine dies.
[10/18, 11:58 AM] Phillip: I try starting 5 times or so and it starts again.
[10/18, 11:59 AM] Phillip: OK maybe the battery was low from all the restarts, or some gunk got sucked into the fuel line.
[10/18, 11:59 AM] Phillip: I idle a bit. It seems OK, so I start again.
[10/18, 12:01 PM] Phillip: I go a few blocks and get on the main road. On the bridge during a red light it dies again. I try to start it a few times, no luck
[10/18, 12:01 PM] Phillip: Cars honking, going around
[10/18, 12:02 PM] Phillip: The next green light I push it through the intersection to an empty parking lot of a closed sink store or something.
[10/18, 12:02 PM] Phillip: A police car was 2 cars behind me. And stops to chat.
[10/18, 12:02 PM] Phillip: He is eating a cupcake. And speaks no English
[10/18, 12:04 PM] Phillip: I didn't understand what he was trying to say, so I called Stan, and they talked for a minute.
[10/18, 12:04 PM] Phillip: The jist was I was OK to park there for the night, but was likely to get broken in to.
[10/18, 12:09 PM] Phillip: Stan says he will try to get ahold of the mechanic and come to me.
[10/18, 12:10 PM] Phillip: In the mean time, I pull out my diagnostic scanner, and pull the codes.
[10/18, 12:11 PM] Phillip: They say problems with the ignition control module and throttle position sensor.
[10/18, 12:11 PM] Phillip: They battery voltage is fine.
[10/18, 12:12 PM] Phillip: Stan shows picks me up, but couldn't find the mechanic
[10/18, 12:12 PM] Phillip: So we go out for tacos
[10/18, 12:13 PM] Phillip: After we eat, the mechanic calls and says he's been swimming.
[10/18, 12:13 PM] Phillip: But he'll meet us at the van in 15 min
[10/18, 12:14 PM] Phillip: Its 9 or so at this point
[10/18, 12:15 PM] Phillip: He checks the fuel pump while I crank. Its fine.
[10/18, 12:15 PM] Phillip: Then he pulls a spark plug wire and it has little to no spark.
[10/18, 12:16 PM] Phillip: So we call a tow truck to take it back to his shop
[10/18, 12:16 PM] Phillip: It takes forever to get there and looks something like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mater_(Cars)
[10/18, 12:18 PM] Phillip: So that goes smoothly, and costs $350 pesos. So much because it's a big vehicle.
[10/18, 12:18 PM] Phillip: Stan drops me off back at our place at around 11.
[10/18, 12:19 PM] Phillip: Anna Lisa set up a tent in the dark. So I can go right to bed.
[10/18, 12:20 PM] Phillip: So now we're waiting on the mechanic to diagnose.
