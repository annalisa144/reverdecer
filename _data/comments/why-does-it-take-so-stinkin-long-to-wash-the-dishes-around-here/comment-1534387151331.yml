  We don't heat water but would like to. I think we should do something with
  black hoses or a tank but Phillip thinks we should dig a shallow pond (3"),
  line it with black plastic and cover it with clear plastic. Maybe he'll work
  on that for my birthday:-) Actually he's going to work on chicken stuff since
  they're getting too crowded. The swimming pool people are coming over in the
  morning, I want to talk with James about the bible study, and we'll do 108 sun
  salutations. You?!
