I used to be bored by bread. And it can be empty calories that tempt one to smother it in butter and sugary jam. But now that I'm keeping a [sourdough starter](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/02/06/sourdoughs/) and using a variety of grains and nuts in bread, I enjoy the simple meals it begins.

But we often prefer using our sourdough starter to make cornbread, which we cover in black beans, mole, avocado and cilantro.

And cornbread is great with butter and jam, too. Or honey. Or eggs and cheese. Or maple syrup and cream cheese.
