Nope, not [Phillip starting a bonfire](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/03/07/controlled-burn-success/) or [putting out a wildfire](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/03/08/wildfire/).

During [our enchanting, quick visit to Guadalajara](http://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2019/03/05/guadalajara/), we spent hours at [Hospicio Cabañas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospicio_Caba%C3%B1as). It's no longer a hospital; it's full of art and education.

Juan Ruiz de Cabañas is there in statue (probably in spirit too!)

but the primary draw is Man on Fire.
