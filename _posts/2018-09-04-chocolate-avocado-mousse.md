This is probably our **least-unhealthy dessert**:

• 2 ripe avocados, chopped/sliced

• 1/2 cup cocoa powder (if you use chocolate chips or baking chocolate you might skip sweetener - just taste)

• 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup milk or coffee

• 1 tsp pure vanilla extract

• 1/8 tsp salt

• 2 tbsp sweetener (to your taste)

Put it all in a blender or food processor until smooth.

We made two batches - one with coffee and one with milk, and couldn't decide which we liked better. You can't go wrong - if someone didn't know this contained avocado I bet they wouldn't notice. My slight preference was for the coffee mousse simply because we poured the coffee in warm and I liked the warm chocolate pudding experience.

But - don't make more than you'll eat in one sitting.  After a day in the cooler we could taste the avocado. It was still delicious, but distracting. Of course you can skim off the top 2 mm to lose the oxidized part, which helps a little.

We experimented with freezing one jar, and its flavor was less-avocado than what had been in the cooler.

As you can see, after thawing a little moisture separated, but we stirred it in and it was fabulous.

Couple things we've tried: cacao nibs and leaving in an avocado pit (packed with nutrients) and found the texture of either distracting.
