message: "This is GREAT!!!! \r\nI'll confess I had given no thought to your upcoming anniversary until Deanna mentioned something about it at AC. In a way, today feels like it should be the anniversary. I think I'm glad we had hot weather the day of your wedding rather than the rain of today!\r\nBtw, the Monday link doesn't work."
